Plants, for example, exhibit traits such as succulence and rhizomes to promote persistence in these conditions, and many organisms are widely dispersed by winds or ocean currents. Consumers like seabirds or seals move between terrestrial and marine environments.","Coastal scrub limited by salinity, water deficit and disturbances (e.g. cliff collapse). Strong gradients from sea to land and highly mobile fauna.","Coastal dunes and cliffs in tropical, temperate and boreal latitudes",https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MT2.1
MT2.2,164,MT2,MT2.2 Large seabird and pinniped colonies,MT2.2 Seabird rookeries,2022-06-29T22:57:24Z,"Large concentrations of roosting or nesting seabirds and semiaquatic mammals such as seals and walrus are found on relatively isolated islands and shores. These animals consume large amounts of marine resources but spend many weeks and months on land, accumulating high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients. The abundance and relatively large body size of individuals disrupt the growth of vegetation. The combination of these factors means that microbial activity is high and soil invertebrates are abundant, but plant diversity is usually low, and land based grazers and predators are usually absent.",Localised areas of bare or vegetated ground with diverse microbial communities at the ocean interface receiving massive nutrient subsidies and disturbance from large concentrations of roosting or nesting seabirds and pinnipeds that function as mobile links between land and sea,"Scattered globally on islands and coastlines, but most common in polar and subpolar regions",https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MT2.2
MT3.1,166,MT3,MT3.1 Artificial shorelines,MT3.1 Artificial shores,2020-05-29T11:58:43Z,"Constructed sea walls, breakwaters, piers, docks, tidal canals, islands and other coastal infrastructure create habitat for marine plants and animals around ports, harbours, and other intensively settled coastal areas. The waters may be polluted by urban runoff or industrial outflows. Opportunities for introduction of invasive species e.g. through shipping mean that non-native species are common. Foodwebs are simple and dominated by species able to opportunistically colonise these structures through dispersal of eggs, larvae and spores.  Commonly, these include algae and bacteria, and filter-feeders like sea-squirts and barnacles.","Coastal infrastructure, such as seawalls, breakwaters, pilings and piers, extending from the intertidal to subtidal, supporting cosmopolitan sessile and mobile invertebrates and macroalgae on their hard surfaces, and in some instances serving as artificial reefs for fish","Globally, along urbanised coastlines",https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MT3.1
MFT1.1,168,MFT1,MFT1.1 Coastal river deltas,MFT1.1 River deltas,2020-01-20T12:00:00Z,"At the convergence of terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms, coastal river deltas are shaped by river inflows that deposit sediment and ocean tides and currents that disperse it. Gradients of salinity and submergence and dynamic substrates create shifting mosaics of channels, islands, floodplains, intertidal and subtidal mud plains and sand beds that may be regarded as embedded patches of other functional groups. The dynamic mosaics support complex foodwebs. Planktonic algae, aquatic plants and river inflows contribute detritus for in-sediment fauna. Fish and zooplankton are diverse and abundant in the water column, providing food for wading and fishing birds and marine and terrestrial predators.","Depositional, mosaic systems with strong gradients between terrestrial, freshwater and marine elements.

The biota includes aquatic and terrestrial species, and intertidal specialists. Large volumes of mangrove leaves and twigs are decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients for invertebrates such as crabs, worms and snails. Shellfish and juvenile fish are protected from desiccation and predators amongst mangrove roots. Mangrove canopies support many terrestrial species, particularly birds. These forests are important carbon sinks, retaining organic matter in sediments and living biomass.","Intertidal mangrove-dominated systems, producing high amounts of organic matter that is both buried in situ and exported; sediments dominated by detritivores and leaf shredders, with birds , mammals, reptiles and terrestrial invertebrates occupying the canopy",Tropical and warm temperate coastlines with good sediment supply,https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.2

Salts may approach hypersaline levels near the limit of high spring tides, especially in the tropics. As well as larger plants, algal mats and phytoplankton contribute to productivity, while freshwater run-off and tides bring organic material and nutrients. Bacteria and fungi decompose biomass in oxygen-poor subsoils, and support a range of crustaceans, worms, snails and small fish.
