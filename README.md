### Background

Over the last few decades, the Earth observation market has grown rapidly. The global satellite Earth observation market alone was valued at US$7,705 billion in 2021 and is expected to double by 2030. Earth observation–based services are powering investments in sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, health, transport, utilities, mining, and finance. In addition, there is a hard-to-quantify, non-market value for Earth observations.

However, when it comes to the Earth's ecosystems-the foundational systems that sustain human, plant, and animal life on Earth-investment in Earth observation services has been inadequate. Despite the information and technology available, existing data are inconsistent, incomplete, or widely dispersed.

### An atlas to meet global demands
Around the world, there is significant momentum for designing new, regenerative systems to help address existential threats from climate change and biodiversity loss. Additionally, stakeholders in the GEO community and beyond recognize the need for increased accountability in environmental agreements and policy frameworks.

###### <font color="red">The Global Ecosystems Atlas will be an open user-friendly online resource that brings together high-quality ecosystems data in a single place.</font>  

### Atlas repository
The GEO Global Ecosystem Atlas will bring together high-quality global, regional and national ecosystem maps into a single, open, online resource. Presenting the extent, structure and function of the world’s ecosystems in unprecedented detail, the Atlas will enable everyone—from governments to individual citizens—to take action to protect nature.

This repository contains the source software developed for the GEO Atlas project. A full description of the methods, validation, and limitations of the data produced by this software will be made available at a future date. For project updates and further information, please refer to the [GEO Global Ecosystem Atlas website](https://earthobservations.org/solutions/incubators/global-ecosystems-atlas).


### FAIR Principles
As an open science project, the Global Ecosystems Atlas is committed to the *FAIR Guiding Principles of data management and stewardship*:

  * **Findable:**
    Atlas data will be assigned a globally unique/persistent identifier, linked to and described with rich metadata and indexed in a searchable resource.

  * **Accessible:**
    Atlas data will be retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol, open, free, and universally implementable. This protocol will facilitate authentication and authorization and ensure metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

  * **Interoperable:**
    Atlas data will use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

  * **Reusable:**
    The Atlas will serve data from a range of sources and will be richly described with a range of accurate and relevant attributes, including licences and provenance.


### Code
This repository contains Python (for ESRI products) and Javascript (for Google Earth Engine) code for developing the major products being developed to bring together the world's spatial data on ecosystem extent and change.  Major aspects of the project include:

1. Database of existing ecosystem map products, hosting source metadata and licensing information.
2. Data repository of existing ecosystem map products, hosting spatial datasets of ecosystem distributions.
3. Data processing routines.
4. Routines for developing the baseline global ecosystem extent data product.
5. Online visualisation and access to GEO Atlas data products.


### Citation
Information on how to cite the atlas will be available at a future date.
