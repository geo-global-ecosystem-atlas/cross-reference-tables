In upland areas, vascular plant cover is generally very sparse (< 2%), often in crevices between stones or small cryoturbated polygons and hummocks (< 50 cm diameter). Snow-flush communities, composed mainly of bryophytes and biological soil crusts with cyanobacteria, often form dark streaks on the otherwise barren lands of bioclimate subzones A and B.
