The regeneration of the dominant species, Nothofagus dombeyi, seems to depend strongly on large-scale disturbances, whether natural or anthropogenic, such as fires, avalanches or landslides, behaving as a colonizer of lands devoid of forest. Under the canopy of Nothofagus dombeyi, species that are more tolerant to shade are associated, which colonize the gaps created by the fall of one or a few trees and remain under the canopy, increasing their dominance until the definitive disappearance of the oldest individuals of N. dombeyi. Nothofagus dombeyi and Eucryphia cordifolia are capable of regenerating in the face of small-scale disturbances caused by tree falls, when they have favorable substrate conditions and low plant densities in the undergrowth. Large-scale disturbances (e.g., alluvium, lava flows) favour the initial establishment of Racomitrium lanuginosum communities, which are later replaced by Senecio chilensis grasslands and then by Gaultheria poeppigii thickets that finally give way to forest formation. The Holcus lanatus - Agrostis tenuis grassland community appears where cattle have been introduced, which when abandoned are replaced by Rubus ulmifolius - Ulex europaeus communities.
