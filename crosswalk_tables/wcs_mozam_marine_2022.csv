Extent is limited in the shallows by wave action and tidal exposure, and at depth by light availability. Productive ecosystems, their three-dimensional structure provides shelter for juvenile fish, invertebrates and epiphytic algae. Diverse organisms live in and around seagrass beds including many grazers, from tiny invertebrates to megafauna such as dugongs.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.1","ValueToValue",,"Ben_Cresswell","Final",,NA,NA,2.1,NA,NA,"001","0183001"

Nutrients falling from upper ocean layers and delivered by currents from the shelf support diverse communities of microbial decomposers, detritivores like crabs and demersal fish, and their predators, but sessile animals are rare and algae are absent. Biomass is relatively low and peaks at mid-slope, diminishing with depth as food and temperature decrease and bathymetric pressure increases.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M3.1","ValueToValue",,"Ben_Cresswell","Final",,NA,NA,2.1,NA,NA,"001","0183001"
