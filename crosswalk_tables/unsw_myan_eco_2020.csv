Tanintharyi island rainforest occurs on offshore islands across Tanintharyi, including the Myeik archipelago. It is a lowland, primarily evergreen, forest ecosystem that has some maritime influence. It shows a tolerance of salty ocean seaspray and historically received much of its nutrient input from nesting seabird populations that have subsequently collapsed. It occurs across a wide range of island types including limestone, rubble and sand islands. The canopy is primarily evergreen Dipterocarpaceae (Tagane et al., 2019). Stamp (1924b) reported forests of “tall varied trees who dense canopy, cutting off nearly all light from the ground, is made more intense by the wealth of woody climbers which have struggled upwards to reach the light”. 
Distribution
Occurs on offshore islands in Tanintharyi state. 
Characteristic native biota
Largely unknown but probably moderately diverse. A recent survey of the Myiek archipelago reported a total of 305 species belonging to 241 genera and 91 families (Tagane et al. 2019).  Surveys of Lampi Island marine park indicated 20 species of Dipterocarpaceae. The islands support several localized species along the coastal edges including Great-billed Heron Ardea sumatrana, Beach Thick-knee Esacus magnirostris (NT) and Black-naped Tern Sterna sumatrana, and Collared Kingfisher Todiramphus chloris. The islands also support a range of nomadic frugivores including Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica (NT), Large Green-pigeon Treron capellei (VU), Pied Imperial-pigeon Ducula bicolor, and Plain-pouched Hornbill Rhyticeros subruficollis (VU). 
 
 
The islands also support a population of tool using Long-tailed Macaque Macaca fascicularis.
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs on offshore islands exposed to the influence of maritime salt. Largely monsoonal, with a minimum temperature of 21 degrees in December to a maximum of 28.8 in August. Precipitation is highly seasonal, with a dry season occurring from November to March followed by a strong wet season from May to October (Oo et al., 2019).
Key processes and interactions
This ecosystem received much of its nutrients from nesting seabird populations that are mostly no longer present. Dispersal is similarly mediated by mobile fauna, and endemism due to isolation is likely to be high. 
Major threats
Unregulated tourism development is the principal threat to this ecosystem (UNESCO, 2014).",1,"T1.1","Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests","A huge diversity of species occupy niches within a complex vertically-layered structure of plant forms.

Tanintharyi has extensive patches of limestone karst scattered across the region. In these karst landscapes Tanintharyi limestone tropical evergreen forest occurs. Primary tree species are Dipterocarps that form a closed canopy, although they occur at lower density and lower tree height than surrounding lowland and upland evergreen forest ecosystems. Soils are characteristically extremely shallow and acidic, and may be humus-rich. These forests can be found across the Tanintharyi lowlands on limestone hills and slopes, and in some cases may occur on very steep slopes and cliffs. As a result of the discontinuous distribution of limestone in Myanmar, which can frequently become very dry, endemism is very high. For example, 12 new karst-adapted species of gecko were recently discovered in karst environments, some of which are restricted to isolated caves and limestone towers (Grismer et al. 2018). Reliable year round rainfall, averaging in excess of 100 mm per month and between around 1,900 mm and 3,000 mm per year. 
Distribution
Occurs in karst landscapes in southern Tanintharyi. We used a global karst layer to refine our maps of this ecosystem type, and further work to map karst landscapes in southern Myanmar is recommended.
Characteristic native biota
Characteristic species of this ecosystem remain relatively unknown. Stamp (1924b) lists the tree species occurring in this ecosystem as including Dipterocarpus alatus, D. grandiflorus, and D. turbinatus, Shorea spp, Anisoptera sp., Hopea odorata, and Parashorea stellata.
 
This ecosystem occurs in isolated fragments and has high physical complexity, a suite of microhabitats, and relatively stable climate, this ecosystem provides habitat for a large number of endemic species, including gekkos and molluscs (Whitten et al., 1997; Grismer et al., 2018

Abiotic environment
Shallow soils that can be fairly acidic, topographically complex and reliable year-round rainfall of >100 mm per month and warm temperature that rarely fall below 10° C. 
Key processes and interactions
Distribution is largely defined by the occurrence of Karst landscapes coinciding with a mean monthly rainfall of around 100 mm per month. This ecosystem may periodically become very dry, but a dense evergreen canopy can support humid microclimates throughout these periods (Whitten et al., 1997). 
Major threats
Unregulated quarrying is considered a primary threat to this ecosystem (Grismer et al., 2018). In addition, deforestation is widespread in this region, primarily for the development of oil palm plantations, rubber plantations and other agroforestry, with deforestation rates reaching 7.85% in some areas of Tanintharyi, the highest rate of forest loss so far recorded in Myanmar (Connette et al., 2017).",1,"T1.1","Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests","A huge diversity of species occupy niches within a complex vertically-layered structure of plant forms.

This ecosystem occurs at higher elevation (mostly >200 m, Connette et al., 2016) across Tanintharyi state. Differs to lowland sundaic evergreen forest by having a lower mean canopy height, increased presence of conifers (Kress et al., 2003) and reduced leaf area index as a result of smaller mean leaf size. These higher altitude areas have lower mean annual precipitation and lower mean temperature than lowland sundaic evergreen forest. This ecosystem is very diverse, with a closed canopy consisting primarily of Dipterocarpaceae. Buttressed trees common, epiphytes, ferns and lianas are present, and mosses and lichens are likely to be more abundant than in adjacent lowland forests. Very diverse fauna community with birds, bats and insects being important pollinators in the canopy.

This very diverse, closed-canopy, non-sundaic rainforest comprises a diverse suite of trees including prominent Dipterocarpaceae, but few emergents. Buttressed trees are common, epiphytes, ferns and lianas are abundant. Canes, palms and bamboos are present in the understorey, and become abundant in areas of high disturbance. This ecosystem has a more seasonal climate, and a less diverse biota than upland and lowland rainforests further south in Tanintharyi. Nevertheless, it supports a diverse fauna community with birds, bats and insects being important pollinators in the canopy. 
Distribution
Occurs in areas of Kayin state that have reliable year-round rainfall of at least 100 mm per month. 
Characteristic native biota
The biota of these forests is largely unreported, but is expected to be transitional between the elevated subtropical rainforests of the western Shan plateau and the Sundaic tropical rainforests of Tanintharyi (Davis, 1960). Stamp (1924b) lists the tree species occurring in tropical evergreen forests in Tanintharyi as including Dipterocarpus alatus, D. grandiflorus, and D. turbinatus, Shorea spp, Anisoptera scaphula, Hopea odorata, and Parashorea stellata, all from the Dipterocarpaceae. Ground cover includes canes, palms and bamboos.

Abiotic environment
Reliable year-round rainfall of >100 mm per month, but maximum rainfall in June-November and warm temperature that rarely fall below 10° C. Mean annual rainfall is about 2,960 mm and mean annual temperature 25.2° C. Soils are relatively fertile loams and clay loams.
Key processes and interactions
Distribution is largely defined by mean monthly rainfall of at least 100 mm per month and in excess of mean evapotranspiration. Reliably warm and moist conditions support continuous growth and recruitment of trees and a complex trophic web. Dense canopy generates humid microclimates and abundant shade and is likely to promote gap-phase dynamics.

No confirmed occurrences of this ecosystem remain. However, Davis (1960) mapped all of Rakhine as Tropical rain forest and noted that evergreen tropical rainforest occurs where annual rainfall is >2,250 mm. This suggests that small areas of southern Rakhine were once evergreen forest, occurring where weather is warm throughout the year and wet enough to compensate a short dry season. tropical rainforests in climatically comparable areas to the east of the Ayeyarwady delta in Kayin state have complex structure and closed tree canopies up to 40 m tall, with numerous epiphytes and few deciduous species present, unlike forests further north on the Rakhine Range. Owing to extensive agricultural expansion and forest cutting for hardwood, this ecosystem is likely to be collapsed. If any small patches remain, they are likely to be under severe human pressure.
Distribution
The original distribution of this ecosystem was likely to be restricted to a relatively small portion of the southern Rakhine Range, to the west and northwest of the Ayeyarwady delta. It would have been isolated from other tropical rainforests by a matrix of semi-evergreen forests and savannas exposed to more severe dry-season water deficits. Small patches may remain in southern Rakhine, but these have not been confirmed.
Characteristic native biota
No information on the characteristic species of this ecosystem was found, however, descriptions of tropical ranforests by Stamp (1924b) and Davis (1960) are likely to be indicative. When intact, the ecosystem is likely to have supported a diverse megafauna, including Asian Elephant Elephas maximus (EN).
 
Abiotic environment
Southern Rakhine has warm minimum temperatures (mean temperature of coldest month is 20.7° C) and our data suggests mean annual rainfall is in excess of 3,000 mm.
Key processes and interactions
Reliable water availability from regular rainfall, warm temperatures, rich soils are likely key to sustaining this ecosystem and its complex trophic web through small-scale gap-phase dynamics. Occasional destructive monsoonal storms are likely to have driven larger successional changes.

This is a complex evergreen rainforest that occurs on rich limestone and shale soils on the western Shan plateau. The closed tree canopy is up to 25-40 m tall, with a diversity of notophyll to microphyll leaf sizes. The trees represent a diverse array of plant families, and some have buttress roots and cauliflory. Epiphytic orchids and ferns, and lianas are abundant in the tree canopy. The understorey includes ferns and forbs. Subtropical rainforest on the western Shan plateau typically forms distinct mosaics with Shan Hills pine savanna with fine-scale distributions probably mediated by water availability and occurrence of fire. However, the rainforest matrix has been severely fragmented by intensive agricultural land use. A particularly good remnant example of this ecosystem can be found at Ye Aye reservoir, Kalaw. 
Distribution
Distributed in small fragments between about 900 m and 1,400 m elevation along the western Shan plateau. 
Characteristic native biota
The biota is likely to share some affinities with distant subtropical rainforests of upper Myanmar and Yunnan plateau in China including Scimitar-babblers and their allies (Timaliidae) as well as the recently described Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon Hoolock tianxing (EN).
Abiotic environment
Western Shan Plateau subtropical evergreen rainforest occurs in areas with reliable year-round rainfall of between about 1,400 and 2,000 mm, with the majority falling during June-November. Forms on rich limestone and shale soils at elevations of 900-1,400 m. 
  
Most fragments remain on slopes and hills, although some small remnant patches occur on flatter areas of the Shan plateau.
Key processes and interactions
Reliable water availability from regular rainfall, warm temperatures and the occurrence of rich soils support a highly diverse ecosystem. These conditions support continuous growth and gap-phase recruitment of trees and a complex trophic web. Dense-canopies and abundant rainfall maintain a humid micro-climate, with thick leaf litter that is not fire-prone unless fragmented by human activity.

The Kachin hills subtropical rain forest is a biologically complex, closed canopy lower montane forest. It is mainly found between 700 – 1,500 m where there are high moisture levels. Kingdon-Ward (1944) defined the lower limit of this zone as roughly the winter mist line, which is the altitude above which winter mists do not normally lie. The upper limit of this ecosystem corresponds roughly with the upper distribution of palm species such as Pinanga sylvestris and Wallichia caryotoides (Arecaceae). Within this zone there is a transition of taxa from those with tropical to subtropical-temperate affinities. Rhododendron (Ericaceae) first appears within the ecosystem at around 1,000 m in altitude. Epiphytes, including many ferns and Ericaceous shrubs (e.g. Vaccinium and Agapetes) become more common at the higher elevations in this zone. Due to the exceptionally high moisture levels, woody taxa which are typically terrestrial become epiphytes here, completely covering the trees. This evergreen subtropical forest is found at higher elevations and often higher slope than Kachin lowland evergreen subtropical forest.

This semi-evergreen forest is scattered across eastern Tanintharyi, Kayin and Mon states. The tree canopy is primarily deciduous, although some evergreen species may occur (Davis, 1960; Connette et al., 2016). Connette et al (2016) defined this ecosystem as having a closed canopy (>80% canopy cover) comprising a mixture of trees with and without leaves during the dry season, and estimated that it accounts for about 10.8% of Tanintharyi state. Occurs in areas with highly seasonal rainfall, averaging 1,500 to 2,500 mm per annum. The ecosystem is mostly contiguous intact forest, however, road development is opening large areas of Tanintharyi up for deforestation and plantation (Connette et al., 2016).
Distribution
Occurs across north and north-eastern Tanintharyi Region, Mon and Kayin states (Davis, 1960; Connette et al., 2016; De Alban et al., 2018).
Characteristic native biota
The biota of these forests is poorly known. No studies of Myanmar’s forests were found that listed the characteristic species in this ecosystem type. The forests may have a largely evergreen mature stage with emergent deciduous diperocarps, and a deciduous pioneer phase (Ashton, 2014). Lagerstroemia calyculata (Lythraceae), Afzelia xylocarpa (Fabaceae), Xylia xylocarpa (Fabaceae), Pterocarpus marsupium (Fabaceae) and Syzygium (Myrtaceae) species may be in the canopy, but composition varies depending on soil texture. 
 
 
Dipterocarpus turbinatus (Dipterocarpaceae) and Tectona grandis (Lamiaceae) are present in the northern part of the distribution (Mon State), but unlike other semi-evergreen forest ecosystems in Myanmar, they are largely absent from most of the forests in this ecosystem. 
Several species of large crown vines are conspicuous components of the system, with Zingerberaceae (gingers) in the ground layer (Ashton, 2014). 
The avifauna is similar to East Myanmar dry valley forest with species such as Chestnut-headed Bee-eater Merops leschenaulti, Lineated Barbet Psilopogon lineatus, Red-breasted Parakeet Psittacula alexandri, Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria and Purple Sunbird Cinnyris asiaticus. This ecosystem can support lower populations of large mammals that include Leopard Panthera pardus (VU) and Sambar Cervus unicolor (VU).
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs in areas with moderately high rainfall with high seasonality. Mean annual temperature is 24.8°C and mean rainfall is 2500 mm, with most rainfall occurring in a distinct wet season, punctuated by a 4-5 month dry season.
Key processes and interactions
Rainfall seasonality and seasonal water stress is a key factor that influences the distribution and species composition of seasonally dry ecosystems such as Tanintharyi semi-evergreen forest (Banda et al., 2016). Rainfall patterns drives seasonal patterns of growth productivity and leaf phenology in deciduous trees, as well as flowering and fruit production, which flows through complex trophic networks including herbivorous canopy arthropods, nectivorous insects, frugivorous mammals and birds, predators and invertebrate detritivores. Dry season fires may occur occasionally on the forest floor. The biota may have some tolerance to fire but flammability is likely to be low, except in areas where there are large tracts of bamboo.
Major threats
Considerable areas of this ecosystem have been degraded as a result of shifting cultivation and development of rubber plantations (Connette et al., 2016). New road development has opened large areas of this forest and is expected to continue to pressure this ecosystem (Connette et al., 2016).",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","58","Rocky Taninthayri karst","Description
Rocky Tanintharyi Karst is a forest type that occurs in karst landscapes. Karst landscapes are commonly defined as areas where highly soluble and porous rocks such as limestone support distinctive hydrology and landforms (Ford and Williams, 2007). These landscapes often have a complex topography, widespread presence of caves and underground water systems. Where a soil layer can form, such as gullies, a vegetation community consisting of herbaceous species and bryophytes can form (Clements et al., 2006). 
Karst environments show high degrees of endemism and high diversity among isolated patches. Such endemism results from extreme niche diversity afforded by their complex terrain and high isolation among fragments. In Myanmar, all three Karst ecosystems (MMR-S1.1.1, MMR-T1.1.3 and MMR-T1.2.2) are expected to have high biodiversity and endemism. However, increasing quarrying and other impacts are a key concern.
Distribution
This ecosystem occurs primarily in the karst landscapes of Tanintharyi, although patches may also occur in Karen State, Mon State and Shan State (Day and Urich, 2000). No map data is available for this ecosystem.
Characteristic native biota
Although very little is known about this karst ecosystem, it likely includes a large number of endemic calcicolous species that may be restricted to very small areas (Grismer et al, 2018). There is a single near-endemic bird, Greyish Limestone-babbler Turdinus crispifrons restricted to this ecosystem in Myanmar and neighboring Thailand.
Recent studies have shown that the rate of discovery of new species of karst-associated amphibians and reptiles is high, and recent studies have discovered nearly 30 new species in just three years. It is expected that targeted field work will fill this knowledge gap in this ecosystem. 
Abiotic environment
The occurrence of limestone substrate. Karst systems are rugged, rugose and steep elevation change is common, which influences the vegetation species that occur (Qi et al., 2019).
Key processes and interactions
Water coming into limestone caves and aquifers is acidified by carbon dioxide from plant root respiration and by organic acids released by vegetation. The acidified water dissolves limestone and calcium carbonate is deposited in underground caves. Shallow soils associated with Karst landscapes influence the structure and species composition of karst vegetation communities.

Major threats
Limestone quarrying for cement production is considered a key threat to karst environments in Myanmar (Forest Department, 2015, BirdLife/FFI/IUCN/WWF, 2015). The key stages of limestone extraction include clearing extraction sites, often using a bulldozer, and stripping of topsoil, trees and vegetation using excavators. The subsequent stages include drilling and blasting to expose and excavate the desired rock, before loading excavated rock onto front-end loaders. The limestone is then crushed and separated in stockpiles, which are ultimately loaded onto trucks for transport to Yangon or other markets or storage places. In nearby China, karst landscapes that have been subject to farming over-exploitation have resulted in karst rocky desertification, the process of which soil is partially or completely eroded (Qi et al., 2019).",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

Mixed cane brake occurs in valleys and gulleys in the wetter regions of Myanmar, where rainfall is over about 2,500 mm per year, particularly in Tanintharyi and Kayin. It occurs as a dense thicket of canes, palms and bamboos (Platt et al., 2001; Stamp, 1924b;. Kress et al., 2003). 
Distribution
Mixed cane brake is distributed in moist valleys throughout southeast Myanmar, where it primarily occurs in association with evergreen rainforest. 
Characteristic native biota
Stamp (1925) states that the typical species occurring in this ecosystem are palms such as Calamus arborescens, Licuala peltata and Zalacca wallichiana, together with canes (Calamus spp.) (Arecaceae) and creeping bamboos (Poaceae). 
Abiotic environment
Little is known about the abiotic features that influence the distribution and functioning of this ecosystem. It is thought to occur in particularly wet areas, particularly along riverbanks where there is ample access to freshwater, a moist microclimate and a short dry season (Stamp, 1924b).
Key processes and interactions
Similar to bamboo brake ecosystems, mixed cane brake is often formed when cane, creeping bamboo and palms that occur naturally as undergrowth respond rapidly to forest disturbance. Following disturbance, often caused by deforestation, tree falls, storms or fire, high levels of light stimulate dense growth of palms and bamboo that develop into impenetrable thickets (Kress et al, 2003).

Rainfall seasonality and seasonal water stress is a key factor that influences the distribution and species composition of seasonally dry ecosystems such as Bago semi-evergreen forest (Banda et al., 2016). The dominant tree species are drought-deciduous, enabling them to persist through prolonged water deficits in the dry season, and support rapid growth when monsoon rains fuel primary productivity. Flammability is likely to be low, except where extensive disturbance has promoted increased fire activity, particularly in areas with large tracts of bamboo regrowth.
Major threats
The ecosystem has been extensively logged, fragmented by shifting cultivation and the development of plantations (Shimuzu et al., 2017). Only tiny patches of primary forest remain, with the vast majority of this ecosystem now occurring as highly degraded forest regrowth dominated by bamboo. Post-disturbance bamboo thicket may be a persistent steady state, with dense stands limiting dispersal and establishment of tree species typical of primary forest. They may also maintain a fire regime that limits establishment of primary forest species. The impact of shifting cultivation has been reported to be decreasing in the last decade, while logging, plantation development, urban development and water conversion (new dams) have expanded (Shimuzu et al., 2017). Poaching of wild fauna, including elephants, appears regular (Sampson et al., 2018).",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

This ecosystem occurs on the rocky foothills of the eastern dry zone and is characterised by the presence of thorny species mixed with low bushy Dahat (Tectona hamiltoniana). Low canopy of less than 5 m and very sparse. Occurs on both limestone and siltstone. Includes succulent Euphorbia, some patchy Themeda and Aristida, but grass cover may be continuous enough to carry fire. Bamboo may be present. 
Distribution
This ecosystem is restricted to the foothills surrounding the central dry zone. This ecosystem was particularly difficult to develop a remotely sensed map for due to a lack of training data and field access. We therefore expect this ecosystem may be even further restricted than depicted in this distribution map.
Characteristic native biota
Thorny Euphorbia antiquorum (Euphorbiaceae) are common, and bushes of Diospyros burmanica (Ebenaceae), Tectona hamiltoniana (Lamiaceae) from 1-3 m high. Other species may include Acacia catechu (Fabaceae), and the bamboo Dendrocalamus strictus (Poaceae). Ziziphus oenoplia and Zizyphys jujuba (Rhamnaceae) may also be abundant, along with introduced species such as Jatropha gossypifolia and Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae) (Stamp, 1925, Stamp and Lord, 1923). A range of vines are present in the shrub and ground layers, forbs are present in rocky sites and tussock grasses, including Themeda triandra and Aristida spp. (Poaceae) may be abundant in open patches.

Chatarrhaea gularis. Mammals are limited although Golden Jackal Canis aureus and Burmese Hare Lepus peguensis are still widespread.
Abiotic environment
The mean annual precipitation is low, around 1,200 mm with a regular seasonal drought extends from October to late May, followed by monsoonal rains which deliver the majority of rainfall in period of a few months. Occurs mainly on dry foothills and toeslopes with westerly and southerly aspect, often in rocky sites with clay-loam soils. 
Key processes and interactions
The distribution, amount and timing of rainfall is important in this ecosystem, producing a flush of productivity following the onset of monsoonal rain and a severe water deficit during the dry season. Grazing and burning interact with the fine-scale distribution of rocky substrates that may create refuges. Thus, fires may occur but do not appear to be common. 
Major threats
Similar to surrounding ecosystems, this ecosystem has been impacted extensively by agricultural development (cattle grazing and some cropping; Ashton, 2014). Recurring fires may threaten the persistence of succulent elements such as Euphorbia spp. Disturbance from clearing and cattle grazing promotes the ingress of invasive plants that may exclude native species.",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

Rakhine hills bamboo brake is a dense, monotypic ecosystem dominated by a single bamboo species, Melocanna baccifera (Poaceae; Platt et al., 2010a), although many other species of bamboo occur throughout Myanmar (Bystriakova et al., 2003a, 2003b). It occurs along the Rakhine hills where its high density and vigoruos growing habits inhibit tree growth. In Rakhine, bamboo brake may occur in response to disturbance of other ecosystems, such as Rakhine hills semi-evergreen dry forest (Stamp, 1924b; Davis, 1960). Stamp (1924b) considered that ‘most, if not all’, bamboo break in Myanmar was established following disturbances including shifting cultivation, forest clearing, and frequent fires. 
Distribution
Rakhine hills bamboo brake occurs along the Rakhine Hills in Western Myanmar, where it is thought to cover about 75% of the hilly regions (Platt et al., 2010a). Our remote sensing analysis suggests that this ecosystem has a total extent of around 7,500 km2 along the Rakhine Hills. 
Characteristic native biota
This ecosystem is dominated by monotypic stands of Melocanna baccifera. Diverse fauna assemblages occur in bamboo brake, including primates such as Phayre’s langur Trachypithecus phayrei (EN) and Western Hoolock Gibbon Hoolock hoolock (EN), and carnivores including Dhole Cuon alpinus (EN), Sun Bear Helarctos malayanus (VU) and Asian Black Bear Ursus thibetanus (VU). Asian elephant Elephas maximus (EN) do occur and consume the culms, foliage and seeds of M. baccifera (Platt et al., 2010b). 
  
Historic accounts suggest the presence of Sumatran Rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis (CR), which is now extinct in Myanmar (Platt et al., 2010a). Tiger Panthera tigris (EN) is thought to be extirpated relatively recently, with reports up until about 2008 (Platt et al., 2010b). Very little is known about avifauna and herpetofauna of Rakhine hills bamboo brake, although some observations are provided by Platt et al. (2010a). This ecosystem hosts the endemic Arakan Forest Turtle Heosemys depressa (CR); Platt et al., 2010b, Platt et al., 2014).
Abiotic environment
Bamboo brakes occur throughout the Rakhine Hills up to elevations of 900 m to 1,200 m above sea level, where mean annual precipitation reaches around 3,150 mm which mostly occurs in a pronounced monsoonal wet season from May to October. 
Key processes and interactions
The dominant bamboo is semelparous, having a life cycle with a single reproductive event.  According to a remote sensing study, mass mortality events display wave-like spatiotemporal dynamics between synchronous bamboo flowering, fruiting and mortality, which correlates strongly with increased burned area (Fava and Colombo, 2017). Heavy, dry fuel loads following mass mortality events produce intense fires when they occur, typically in the dry season and following post-fruiting mass mortality events, which are reported in a repeating cycle approximately every 48 years (Fava and Colombo, 2017). The dense regenerative phase further inhibits the establishment of woody species and excludes the incursion of evergreen and semi-evergreen trees from adjacent ecosystem types (Platt et al., 2010a). Fires are therefore a primary process that maintains the Rakhine hills bamboo brake ecosystem (Platt et al., 2010a). 
The bamboos are rhizomatous and able to spread vegetatively over local areas, with new shoots emerging in the wet season. They are resilient to physical disturbance by humans and large animals including elephants. Dense groves of bamboo may be important refuges from predators.
Major threats
This ecosystem type is threatened by deforestation for cultivation, changed fire regimes, and extensive utilisation by rural communities. Fire prior to reproduction of the bamboo may be expected to cause reductions in bamboo density, but many individuals may survive and resprout from rhizomes.",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

A semi-evergreen forest that occurs at mid-elevation across the Rakhine hills. This area experiences an annual seasonally dry period, typically extending up to 7 months between November to May each year, followed by monsoonal rains. Rainfall is typically around 2,000 mm to 2,800 mm, and local elevation and moisture gradients are likely the primary factors that influence its distribution (Wolfhart et al., 2010). It co-occurs with Rakhine dry coastal deciduous and Rakhine hills Bamboo Brake, which occurs at lower elevation and in the coastal lowlands and is distinguished by a very strong browning during the dry season, reflecting most species completely losing their leaves. 
Distribution
Occurs on hilltops and mid-elevations along the Rakhine Arakan hills (Davis, 1960). 
Characteristic native biota
These forests include both evergreen and deciduous dipterocarps, including Dipterocarpus turbinatus, D. alatus, D. obtusifolius, Shorea spp., Hopea odorata and Anisoptera costata (Dipterocarpaceae) (Ashton 2014).

Western Hoolock Gibbon Hoolock hoolock (EN), Leopard Panthera pardus (VU), Asian Elephants Elephas maximus (EN) and Gaur Bos gaurus (VU).
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs where mean annual rainfall is around 2,000 to 2,800 mm. The coastal range has an important orographic influence on monsoons from the Bay of Bengal, enhancing rainfall with elevation. These also bring storms that may disturb forest structure. A seasonally dry period of five to seven months from early November to late May is followed by several months of monsoonal rains (Platt et al., 2010). Typically occurs on a range of mostly sandy-textured soils sheltered slopes and in gullies in the foothills of the range, extending to ridges and hilltops in the upper parts of the Rakhine Range.
Key processes and interactions
Rainfall seasonality defines the distribution of this dry forest ecosystem along the east coast of Myanmar (Banda et al., 2016). Deciduous trees respond to the dry season, but rainfall is sufficient to support co-occurring evergreen species that time their growth to the wet season. Local moisture gradients, including elevation gradients to 600 m, are important influences on composition. Monsoonal storms periodically disturb forest structure and may promote initial regrowth dominated by bamboo. Fire is infrequent and confined to the forest understorey, but may be promoted by human disturbance and bamboo regrowth.
Major threats
The ecosystem has been widely cleared for shifting cultivation and logging for timber harvest, and extensive tracts are now severally degraded by bamboo regrowth. Opening of forest structure promotes high intensity canopy fires that can threaten the persistence of some woody and herbaceous species, as well as forest fauna.",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

Magway dry cycad forest is a very distinctive ecosystem that occurs under drier conditions than other semi-evergreen forests in this region, yet hosts a high proportion of evergreen tree species. It is a seasonally dry tropical forest with elements of dipterocarp (probably Dipterocarpus tuberculatas), Shorea, and Terminalia (Dipterocarpaceae). It characteristically includes Cycads (probably Cycas cf. pectinata). It occurs primarily red sandy soils at the eastern foothills of the Rakhine hills on the western edge of the central dry zone. In this region there is a seasonally dry period of greater than 6 months, where monthly rainfall rarely exceeds 100 mm. Canopy is predominantly low, between 5-10 m. A distinct lack of grass in the understorey, which is rather dominated by copious amounts of leaf litter.

Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs on red sandy soils where there is a seasonally dry period of 5-9 months (Stamp, 1924b; Ashton, 2017). The soils are likely to be low in nutrients.
Key processes and interactions
Ecosystem dynamics are driven by seasonal water stress (Ashton, 2014). However, low levels of soil nutirents are likely to limit the degree of deciduousness to cope with seasonal water deficit, as evergreen phenology offers a more efficient retention of limited nutrients. Owing to thick leaf litter, fires may occur periodically and may play a role in limiting the establishment of seedling semi-evergreen species from adjacent ecosystems

Mean annual rainfall is up to 1,900 mm. A seasonally dry period occurs from October to late May when monsoonal rains arrive, and temperatures are hot, with little seasonal variation. However, the severity of the water deficit is ameliorated by topographic shelter, as these forests are found mainly in gullies.
Key processes and interactions
Rainfall gradients, landform and soil type are probably key drivers of the distribution of this ecosystem. Moist and sheltered gullies are likely to ameliorate dry season water deficits and limit the incursion of fire into this ecosystem, resulting in a restricted distribution surrounded by more flammable savanna ecosystem types.

East Myanmar dry valley forest is a closed-canopy deciduous forest that occurs throughout southern Shan State. In this region there is an annual seasonally dry period, typically around 6 months long between November and May each year, followed by monsoonal rains (Platt et al 2010). Mean annual rainfall is typically around 1400 mm, and local elevation, moisture gradient and soil type are the key factors that influence the distribution of this ecosystem (Wolfhart et al 2010). 
Distribution
Distributed in dry valleys across southern Shan state and south through Kayin to northern Tanintharyi. It occurs across the plateau in rainshadow areas with a regular seasonal water deficit. Owing to access issues, we have been unable to confirm the distribution of this ecosystem. Our distribution map may overpredict the extent of this ecosystem, which we expect to be primarily limited to rain shadow valleys and may not occur as extensively in the south. 
Characteristic native biota
Very little information is available for this ecosystem. We recommend targeted field work to fill this knowledge gap and to develop a detailed ecosystem description. The avifauna is similar to other dry forest ecosystems in the region with species such as Chestnut-headed Bee-eater Merops leschenaulti, Lineated Barbet Psilopogon lineatus, Red-breasted Parakeet Psittacula alexandri, Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria and Purple Sunbird Cinnyris asiaticus. This ecosystem can also support lower populations of large mammals that include Leopard Panthera pardus (VU) and Sambar Cervus unicolor (VU).

 
 
Abiotic environment
Occurs where mean annual rainfall is around 1,250 mm to 1,500 mm, and there is a distinct annual seasonally dry period for about 6 months per year. In the dry period monthly rainfall is normally 0-100 mm, followed by several months of monsoonal rains (Platt et al., 2010). 
Mean annual temperature is 23° C with little variability throughout the year. Mostly occurs on rocky slopes and hills exposed to drying, and may have undergone some clearing in flatter areas. 
Key processes and interactions
Water availability is the key driver of the dynamics of this dry forest ecosystem (Ashton and Seidler, 2014; Banda et al., 2016). The availability of water is probably climatic but may also include an edaphic component, (Ashton and Seidler, 2014). The amount and timing of monsoonal rains determine annual flushes of productivity in vegetation. Fires may reduce the establishment of evergreen tree species and maintain the predominantly deciduous phenology of the ecosystem (Ashton and Seidler, 2014). 
Major threats
The ecosystem is thought to have been widely cleared for agriculture, primarily cropland. Increasing numbers and regularity of bushfires promoted by local clearing and burning activity promotes ingress of grasses, making the ecosystem more flammable and may reduce the persistence of key herbaceous and woody species (Ratnam et al., 2011).",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

Characteristic native biota
These forests are dominated by a closed canopy of evergreen trees 20-25m tall, with a subdominant component of deciduous species, many of which are pioneer species. Stamp (1924) suggests that Xylia xylocarpa (Fabaceae) is the main tree species in this ecosystem, and teak is almost totally absent. Lagerstroemia (Lythraceae) and Dalbergia (Fabaceae) species occur throughout, as do several leguminous tree species, and the main dipterocarps are Dipterocarpus alatus and D. turbinatus (Dipterocarpaceae). 
  
Primary bamboos are Bambusa polymorpha and Cephalostachyum pergracile (Poaceae; Stamp 1924b). The ground cover includes vines, forbs and fernsbut grasses are comparatively sparse.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","42","Indaing forest","Description
Indaing forest is a diverse seasonally dry tropical forest dominated by the canopy dipterocarp Dipterocarpus tuberculatas, a slow growing, large-leaved deciduous hardwood species (Aung et al., 2004). A diverse range of tree genera cohabit the forest. Across its distribution, this ecosystem ranges from almost entirely deciduous (Songer et al., 2006) to seldom completely leafless (Ashton, 2014). 
Indaing was formerly very extensive in Myanmar but deforestation due to widespread agricultural expansion has resulted in fragmentation and extensive deforestation. It is now restricted to the margins of the dry zone, with only a few intact remnants remaining, including in Chattin Wildlife Sanctuary (Songer et al., 2006). 
Distribution
This ecosystem is found in a horseshoe shaped area wedged between the countries northern hill regions and the central dry zone (Songer et al., 2006). 
Characteristic native biota
Indaing is dominated by the dipterocarp Dipterocarpus tuberculatas (In) with Shorea siamensis (Ingyin), Shorea obtusa (Thitya) (Dipterocarpaceae), Tectona grandiflora (teak) (Lamiaceae), Vitex pubescens (Kyun-gaung-nwe) (Lamiaceae), Anthocephalus cadamba (Ma-U) (Rubiaceae), Syzygium fastigiatum (Thabye) (Myrtaceae), Firmiana colorata (Wet-shaw) (Malvaceae), Erythrina suberosa (Kathit) (Fabaceae), Ficus cunia (Ka-dut), Ficus benghalensis (Pyi-nyaung) (Moraceae), Dalbergia spp.(Fabaceae), Lannea coromandelica (Nabe) (Anacardiaceae), Pentacme suavis 
  
(Malvaceae), Terminalia (Combretaceae) and Melanorrhea (Anacardiaceae) (Songer et al., 2009, Ashton 2016).
Patches of bamboo, Gigantochloa auriculata (Thaike-wa) (Poaceae) are scattered through the forest. Vines, including ratans, Calamus spp (kyein) (Arecaceae) occur occasionally, as do epiphytes such as the fern Platycerium (Polypodiaceae) but these are less common than in evergreen forests. The forest floor includes forbs, ferns such as Microsorium (Polypodiaceae) and subshrubs such as Zingiber spp.(Zingiberaceae), 
The tree canopy is between 10 and 30 m, sometimes to 40 m in the northwest (Ashton, 2014), and some authors recognise two community types (high and low Indaing) depending on canopy height and structure. However, both are dominated by deciduous dipterocarps including Dipterocarpus tuberculatus, Shorea obtusa, Shorea siamensis (Dipterocarpaceae) and are considered a single ecosystem type here. Grassland and evergreen patches are found throughout this ecosystem (Songer et al., 2009). 
The avifauna is similar to much of the dry forests across Myanmar with populations of Chestnut-headed Bee-eater Merops leschenaultia, Lineated Barbet Psilopogon lineatus, Streak-throated Woodpecker Picus xanthopygaeus, Yellow-crowned Woodpecker Leiopicus mahrattensis, White-rumped Pygmy-falcon Polihierax insignis (NT), Red-breasted Parakeet Psittacula alexandri (NT), Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria (NT), Oriental Paradise-flycatcher Terpsiphone affinis, Burmese Shrike Lanius collurioides and Purple Sunbird Cinnyris asiaticus.
This ecosystem supports the bulk of the world population of Eld's Deer Cervus eldii thamin (EN), the subspecies endemic to Myanmar. It also supports populations of Golden Jackal Canis aureus, Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis, Jungle Cat Felis chaus, Red Muntjac Muntiacus muntjac and Burmese Hare Lepus peguensis.
Abiotic environment
Indaing occurs in hilly terrain around the dry zone of Myanmar where rainfall averages 1,200-1,500 mm per annum and there is a seasonally dry period of 5-9 months (Ashton, 2014). Stamp (1924b) noted that Indaing forest typically occurs in sandy soils.
Key processes and interactions
Ecosystem dynamics are driven by seasonal edaphic water stress mediated by local topography and substrate rather than seasonality (Ashton 2014). This ecosystem type occasionally experiences ground fires, which burn through thick leaf litter but rarely scorch the tree canopy. Fires may limit the establishment of seedling semi-evergreen species in areas where semi-evergreen may otherwise establish. Nevertheless, species from adjacent ecosystems tend to invade Indaing where conditions are moist enough (Ashton 2017).
Major threats
The ecosystem has been widely cleared for agriculture and for subsistence driven deforestation. Shifting cultivation is similarly a key driver of deforestation and is considered a first step towards agricultural conversion (Songer et al 2006). It has also been extensively logged since British invasion as a valuable source of construction timber. This has resulted in transformation of primary forest structure to regrowth, which reduces habitat suitability for mammals and birds that are dependent on mature forest structure.",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","65","Northern semi-evergreen forest","Description
Northern semi-evergreen forest is known by a wide range of names, including mixed deciduous forest, monsoon forest, and semi-evergreen dipterocarp forest. With an extent of around 75,000 km2, it is among the most extensive ecosystem types in Myanmar. It is primarily composed of canopy evergreen dipterocarp species and deciduous pioneer species. Unlike nearby evergreen forest ecosystems epiphytes are relatively uncommon (Rundel, 2009; Ashton, 2014). In contrast to seasonally dry forest ecosystems in northern Myanmar such as Indaing, this ecosystem retains appreciable vegetative cover during the dry season (Songer, 2006). Northern semi-evergreen forest occurs in areas where the dry season is longer than around 4.5 months and primarily on fertile fine-textured soils, although it also occurs on sandy, karst, or clay loam soils (Ashton, 2014). 
Ground fires may occur at moderate frequencies (c. 4-20 year return intervals) in this ecosystem and influences tree recruitment, ground layer composition and structure (Ashton, 2014; Khaing et al., 2019). The extent of deciduousness in this ecosystem is thought to be related to both length of dry season, and increasing nutrient and clay content in the soil (Ashton, 2014). Canopy cover varies from 70 to 85% height extends to around 30 m (Khaing et al., 2019). 
Distribution
Northern semi-evergreen forest forms a broad band across the foothills and hills of north-central and northwestern Myanmar to around 900 m elevation (Khaing et al., 2019). 
 
 
Characteristic native biota
Northern semi-evergreen forest includes dipterocarp species such as Shorea siamensis, Shorea obtusa and Dipterocarpus tuberculatus (Dipterocarpaceae). Numerous other tree families are represented in the canopy. At Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, for example, Northern semi-evergreen forest commonly includes Lannea coromandelica (Anacardiaceae), Celtis timorensis (Cannabaceae), Lophopetalum wallichii (Celastraceae), Terminalia tomentosa (Combretaceae), Chukrasia tabularis (Meliaceae) and Haldina cordifolia (Rubiaceae). (Khaing et al 2019). More broadly, Lagerstroemia (Lythraceae), Xylia (Fabaceae), Dalbergia (Fabaceae), Pterocarpus (Fabaceae), Terminalia (Combretaceae) may also be important canopy genera (Ashton, 2014). Xylia xylocarpa (Fabaceae) is particularly common and the ecosystem sometimes includes teak (Tectona grandis, Lamiaceae), which tends to occur on more fertile soils with high calcium content (Ashton, 2014). Bamboos such as Dendrocalamus strictus (Poaceae), are scattered beneath the tree canopy. The forest floor includes subshrubs, forbs, ferns, vines and graminoids. Commonly encountered species include Hibiscus fragrans (Malvaceae), Cheilocostus speciosus (Costaceae), Curcuma petiolata (Zingiberaceae), Kaempferia candida (Zingiberaceae), the vines Disoscorea persimilis (Dioscoreaceae) and Smilax macrophylla (Smilacaceae), and C4 grasses such as Andropogon fastigiatus and Saccharum ravennae (Poaceae). Plant species richness is generally greater in Northern Semi-evergreen forests than co-occurring Indaing forests, for both trees and ground vegetation (Khaing et al., 2019). 
This large ecosystem supports a range of globally important species which have been well surveyed in several large protected areas in Sagaing Region and Kachin State. This ecosystem includes the country’s best population of White-winged Duck Asarcornis scutulata (EN), and substantial populations of Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis (VU), Austen's Brown Hornbill Anorrhinus austeni (NT), and Wreathed Hornbill Rhyticeros undulates. 
The ecosystem occurs on both sides of the Chindwin River, which is an important biogeographic barrier for primates including Capped Langur Trachypithecus pileatus (VU), Shortridge's Langur Trachypithecus shortridgei (EN), Western Hoolock Gibbon Hoolock hoolock (EN) and Eastern Hoolock Gibbon Hoolock leuconedys (VU). This area also supports a full suite of large carnivores including Dhole Cuon alpinus (EN), Sun Bear Helarctos malayanus (VU), Himalayan Black Bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), Tiger Panthera tigris (EN), Leopard Panthera pardus (VU), Mainland Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosi (VU) and all the smaller cats. Asian Elephant Elephas maximus (EN) are still found throughout this ecosystem as well as large prey species such as Sambar Cervus unicolor (VU), Gaur Bos gaurus (VU), Indochinese Serow Capricornis milneedwardsii (NT) and Red Serow Capricornis rubidus (NT).
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs in hilly areas with more fertile soils than Indaing forests, particularly in relation to soil Potassium and to a lesser degree, Phosphorus and Nitrogen. It is confined to the lowland hills to around 900 m (Khaing et al 2019). These areas in northern Myanmar typically have pronounced dry season lasting up to 6 months (commonly 4.5-6.5 months) and rainfall of around 890-2100 mm per year (Khaing et al 2019). 
Key processes and interactions
An interaction between length of dry season, nutrient availability and disturbance mediates the persistence of semi-evergreen forest ecosystems such as this one (Ashton 2014). These ecosystems have some propensity to burn, as leaf litter and moderate abundance of C4 grasses provide fine fuels, (Khaing et al 2019), But where soils are fertile, however, trees will grow sufficiently fast to overcome fires, maintaining the semi-evergreen character of the forest, rather than transitioning to a savanna or Indaing ecosystem types. Kahing et al. (2019) noted higher soil nutrient levels, particularly Potassium, in Northern semi-evergreen forests compared to Indaing forests, but no detectable difference in fire frequency.
Major threats
Deforestation, logging and shifting agriculture are the main threats to this ecosystem. Mining for gold and amber is also a key threat in some areas (Baghwat et al., 2017). Annual burning of leaf litter for grass for cattle is ubiquitous and may suppress the establishment of evergreen seedlings and saplings (Ashton, 2014).",2,"T1.2","Tropical/Subtropical dry forests and thickets","Tropical-subtropical dry forests and thickets are characterised by fertile substrates and seasonally dry conditions (~1800 mm per year, with a period of 3 to 6 months receiving less than 100 mm per month) that drive markedly seasonal patterns of productivity.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","61","Tanintharyi cloud forest","Description
Only one confirmed occurrence of a cloud forest is known from Myanmar, occurring in the torrid zone at 2,074 m in Kayin state. However, we have mapped all areas >1,950 m in southern Myanmar as potential areas where cloud forest may occur. Cloud forests are closed canopy evergreen forests that have low or stunted canopies (mostly about 5-20 m), small leaf sizes and pervasive mossy cover (Ashton, 2014). Also abundant bryophytes, often covering the majority of the ground, lichens, liverworts, ferns and orchids, all of which utilise atmospheric moisture by cloud stripping. Largely aseasonal due to persistent annual cloud cover. There may be high endemism in flora and fauna. 
Distribution
May occur on a few hill tops at altitudes greater than 1,950 m in Tanintharyi Region, Kayin, Mon and Kayah states. 
Characteristic native biota
There have been no recent studies in this ecosystem. The last ornithological studies were during the colonial period, before World War II. This includes Dark-backed Sibia Heterophasia melanoleuca castanoptera and Green-tailed Sunbird Aethopyga nipalensis karenensis. These were both described form high elevation areas in Kayin State and Southern Shan State. Mammals in these areas are virtually unknown for Myanmar.
Abiotic environment
Altitudinal gradients are critical in forming the abiotic conditions necessary to support cloud forest formation. Cloud formation occurs when saturation deficit declines to zero while temperature declines with altitude (Ashton, 2014). This can occur at around 800 m along coastlines, but in inland areas typically occurs at around 1,000 to 2,000 m (Ashton, 2014). 
  
According to a global analysis, annual cloud cover in altitudes less than 1,950 m is uncommon (Wilson and Jetz, 2014) and no occurrences of cloud forest in Myanmar are known at lower altitudes. We therefore expect suitable abiotic conditions for cloud forest at altitudes over 1,950 m. The mountains identified in our analysis have a mean annual temperature of 16.8° C and precipitation of around 1,300 mm.
Key processes and interactions
Component species of Tanintharyi cloud forest obtain moisture by both direct rainfall and cloud stripping. Persistent cloud cover also leads to reduced temperature and fog penetration into the forest canopy maintains humidity, which is particularly important for epiphytes. Cloud cover also reduces local temperatures, reduces desiccation of individuals, and maintains a microclimate that can support the diverse community of epiphytes (Auld et al., 2015). Storms may also influence dynamics by increasing light penetration through disturbed canopies and allowing weed invasion.
Major threats
Climate change is considered to be a major threat to cloud forests globally (Ponce-Reyes et al., 2011; Auld et al., 2015). With climate warming, it is expected that environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest will decline. The lack of mountains >1,950 m in southern Myanmar suggests that no other areas may become suitable. Similarly, increased storm activity may result in ecosystem collapse through increased light penetration and weed invasion. The construction of roads and temples on high mountain tops may also threaten this ecosystem in some parts of its range.",3,"T1.3","Tropical/Subtropical montane rainforests","These mountain rainforests are characterised by a single-layered tree canopy, with epiphytic ferns, bryophytes, lichens, orchids, and bromeliads draping tree branches.

Kachin mountain conifer forest is comprised of open to dense woodlands of conifers with an understory of hardwoods. Epiphytic shrubs and bryophytes are abundant on the dominant tree species, Abies delavayi. At this altitude deep snow lies for at least a month during the year (Kingdon-Ward, 1944). The tree line occurs around 3,300 to 3,600 m. However, this is variable and depends on the relief. Very steep slopes (50-90°) are exposed to snow and land slides and cannot develop large forests. From this point upwards in altitude the vegetation mainly consists of shrubs, particularly Rhododendron and dwarf bamboo, transitioning into high mountain scrub. At its lowest elevation, this ecosystem overlaps with Kachin deciduous cool temperate forest. 
Distribution
This ecosystem is found in far northern Kachin State in Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponganrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and along Myanmar’s northeast border with China at around 2,700 – 3,600 m.  
Characteristic native biota
From 3,000 m the conifers Abies delavayi and Larix griffithiana (Pinaceae), along with Rhododendron arizelum (Ericaceae), form the dominant vegetation. Tall trees are covered in bryophytes and epiphytic shrubs (Vaccinium, Rhododendron, Agapetes). Trees of lesser stature, including hemlock (Tsuga dumosa, Pinaceae), maple (Acer, Sapindaceae) birch (Betula), hazel (Corylus, Betulaceae), cherry (Prunus, Rosaceae), and mountain ash (Sorbus wardii, S. filipes, S. reheriana, Rosaceae) make up the understory at lower elevations in this zone. Shrubs include numerous species of Rhododendron (R. sino-grande, R. siderum, R. arizelum, R. niphargum R. beesianum, and Vaccinium (Ericaceae), as well as 

  
Skimmia (Rutaceae), Rosa, Rubus (Rosaceae), Deutzia (Hydrangeaceae), Daphne (Thymelaeaceae), Lonicera myrtillus, L. cyanocarpa, (Caprifoliaceae), Ilex intricata, I. georgei, (Aquifoliaceae) and the woody climbers Schisandra (Schizandraceae) and Hydrangea anomala (Hydrangeaceae). Sino-Himalayan herbs such as Paris (Melianthaceae), Podophyllum (Berberidaceae) and Panax pseudoginseng (Araliaceae), Toefieldia thibetica (Toefieldiaceae), Berneuxia thibetica (Diapensiaceae), Hypericum (Hypericaceae), Disporum (Liliaceae), Ainsliaea (Asteraceae), Fritillaria (Liliaceae) and Crawfurdia (Gentianaceae) also make up the flora at this elevation. These herbs include important medicinal plants, which local villagers collect to sell to China. 
The avifauna is predominantely palearctic with species such as Southern Nutcracker Nucifraga hemispila and Coal Tit Periparus ater, Rufous-vented Tit Periparus rubidiventris, and Grey-crested Tit Lophophanes dichrous occurring year-round. This area also supports the only populations of palearctic mammals such as Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Stone Martin Martes foina.
Abiotic environment
Kachin mountain conifer forest can be found on cold ridges and slopes typically ranging from 2,700 to 3,600 m elevation, receiving frequent winter snow, with a deep snow cover persisting for at least one month.
Key processes and interactions
Near the upper limits of their growth, Abies become lower in stature, and many are of wind-blown form. Frosts limit establishment of trees. The treeline is cold-limited, and occurs at around 3,300-3,600 m, with forest transitioning into a subalpine Rhododendron-dominated high mountain scrub ecosystem. Seasonally freezing temperatures and snow cover define a short growing season and limit cold-sensitive species. Soils are relatively shallow and acidic. High relief terrain, often with steep slopes, triggers periodic mass movement, initiating forest succession processes. Vertebrates are either summer migrants from lower elevations or else hibernate during winter.


Major threats
Climate change, and the collection of medicinal herbs and firewood collection are the primary threats to this ecosystem.",7,"T2.1","Boreal and temperate high montane forests and woodlands","In boreal and mountainous cold, seasonally snow-prone climates, acid soils support structurally simple forests made up of needle-leaf conifer trees, sometimes with broad-leaf deciduous trees.

This ecosystem appears to be defined by the lowest altitude at which winter frost is prevalent and above which snow lies for an appreciable time (Kingdon-Ward, 1944). Of all the altitudinal zones, montane temperate broadleaf forest has the greatest diversity of epiphytic flowering plants, ferns and mosses, which is a reflection of the high atmospheric humidity. The flora is predominantly East Asian/Sino-Himalayan in affinity with numerous broad-leaved tree species, which shed their leaves in winter. Between c. 2,000-2,500 m the highest trees in the canopy attain 30 m, and from c. 2,500 – 3,000 m there is a gradual transition to a lower stature broadleaved forest overtopped by taller Abies delavayi. Ericaceous shrubs become more common, even dominant, along exposed ridges – including Enkianthus, Gaultheria, Vaccinium, Pieris, Lyonia, Leucothoe griffithiana and many more species of Rhododendron appear as shrubs, small trees and epiphytes.

Epiphytic shrubs are also common at this altitude, including many taxa, which, in a drier locality, would be terrestrial, these include three species of Sorbus, such as the distinctive S. medogensis (Rosaceae) and Neohymenopogon parasiticus (Rubiaceae). There are fewer woody climbers at this altitude, but the herbaceous vine Crawfurdia (Gentianaceae) is common. Herbs include Sarcopyramis nepalensis (Melastomataceae), Lobelia montana (Campanulaceae), Arisaema (Araceae), Ophiopogon (Asparagaceae), Persicaria (Polygonaceae), and the small epiphyte Polygonatum tesselatum (Liliaceae), which grows on mossy tree trunks. The important medicinal plant Coptis teeta (Ranunculaceae) also occurs here. Endemics in this ecosystem include Acer pectinatum subsp. taronense (Sapindaceae), Berberis hypokerina (Berberidaceae), Prunus kindonwardii (Rosaceae), Rhododendron butyricum and Rhododendron vesiculiferum (Ericaceae), and Juniperus coxii (Cupressaceae).

The eastern side of this ecosystem along the border with Yunnan, China supports the recently described Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkey Rhinopithecus strykeri (CR) and the only records of Tufted Deer Elaphodus cephalophus (NT). There are also significant populations of more widespread species including Red Panda Ailurus fulgens (EN), Gongshan Muntjac Muntiacus gongshanensis (DD) and Red Goral Naemorhedus baileyi (VU).
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem has a temperate climate with some snow fall during November-March. The mean annual temperature is around 12° C with a broad seasonal temperature range and long, cold winters.

Closed-canopy, structurally simple forests with a generally uniform tree height that is conspicuous in lacking emergents. Tree canopies consist of notophyll-microphyll foliage.

Abiotic environment
Shan warm temperate rainforest occurs at higher elevations, extending over about 1,200 m. Mean annual temperature is 16.9 °C, with warmest and coldest quarters 20.5 °C and 11.8 °C. Mean annual precipitation is 1,700 mm. Occurs on mountain tops and sheltered slopes.
 
 
Key processes and interactions
Largely monsoonal climate, but severity of the dry season is ameliorated by altitude, with an overall water surplus, supporting a moist microclimate that sustains vegetation through periods of dry weather. Fauna such as birds, bats and invertebrates are important for pollination and seed dispersal in the canopy, and detritovores on the forest floor are important for nutrient cycling.
Major threats
Conversion of this ecosystem to tea plantations, and deforestation due to logging are the primary threats to this ecosystem. Like all warm temperate rainforests, this ecosystem is not considered flammable due to an overall moist microclimate. However, catastrophic fires resulting from intensive human activity (shifting cultivation), particularly following periods of drought or extended warm weather, may threaten this ecosystem.

An overwhelmingly evergreen closed-canopy forest type occuring in the humid warm temperate areas of north-western Myanmar. This ecosystem is structurally simple, with a relatively uniform canopy consisting of notophyll-microphyll leaf sizes, buttreses are uncommon. Common at elevations over about 1500 m. Oaks (Quercus) and chestnuts (Castanopsis) are common in this ecosystem, and Dipterocarps are generally rare. A particularly good example of this ecosystem is Natma Taung National Park, the highest point in Chin State.
Distribution
Chin hills warm temperate rainforest is widspread across the higher altitude areas of Chin State. 
Characteristic native biota
Fagaceae including Oaks (Quercus) and chestnuts (Castanopsis) are abundant in this ecosystem (Davis, 1960). Other genera include Acer, Betula, Celtis, Capinus, Fraxinus and Magnolia (Davis, 1960). Tree species listed by Davis (1960) for the region include Dipterocarpus alatus (Dipterocarpaceae), Engelhardtia spicata (Juglandaceae), Figus benjamina (Moraceae), and Sterculia coccinea (Malvaceae) (Davis, 1960). However, the forests of the Chin Hills have more subtropical elements than those of the Naga Hills. Rao (1974) lists the following tree genera: Albizia (Fabaceae), Acer (Sapindaceae), Juglans (Juglandaceae), Quercus (Fagaceae), and Magnolia (Magnoliaceae) with Rhododendron (Ericaceae), Rubus spp. (Rosaceae) and scattered Arundinaria bamboo (Poaceae) in the understorey.

Kachin Warm Temperate Rain Forest occurs between c. 1,500 – 2,000 m in montane areas with distinct winter and spring seasons with little snow in winter. What makes this altitudinal zone special is the unique mix of taxa that are typically considered “tropical” with those that are considered “temperate” growing together. Kingdon-Ward (1945) noted that in this zone the temperate rain forest is probably richer in species than any other zone of equal depth in northern Myanmar. Many trees regarded as properly belonging to the “subtropical hill jungle” actually extend far into the temperate zone, and, it is impossible to draw a hard and fast line between the two. A subtler transition is also in effect, where different species in the same genus (e.g. Rhododendron, Symplocos or Magnolia) phase in and out as altitude increases. The upper canopy of this forest attains heights of 30 to 40 m and is heavily burdened with epiphytes. Many of them are shrubs and small trees (Agapetes, Rhododendron, Sorbus medogensis, Aralia leschenaultii, orchids and ferns). The burden of epiphytes and occasional gales cause tree limbs to break, opening the shade of the crown cover and giving way to new forest successions, often with bamboo. 
This forest type is similar to the Kachin hills subtropical rain forest, however, there is not a distinct boundary between the two zones. According to Kingdon-Ward (1944), the lower and upper limits of Exbucklandia populnea mark this ecosystem.
Distribution
From about 1,500 m to over 2,000 m in north-east Myanmar.

Ficus species (Moraceae) taper off in this zone. In the small tree and shrub layer, Rubiaceae gradually become less common with elevation, although Brachytome wallichii, Mycetia longifolia and Lasianthus continue to occur. Simultaneously, Araliaceae (e.g. Dendropanax, Brassaiopsis chengkangensis, Aralia leschenaultii ) and Ericaceae (e.g. Gaultheria, Agapetes, Rhododendron, Vaccinium) begin to increase in occurrence. Microtropis latifolia (Celastraceae), Hydrangea davidii, Hydrangea robusta (Hydrangeaceae), Myrsine semiserrata (Primulaceae), Camellia pachysandra (Theaceae), Debregeasia longifolia (Urticaceae), and Dobinea vulgaris (Anacardiaceae) occur in this zone. Climbers include Maesa, Embelia subcoriacea (Primulaceae), Streptolirion volubile (Commelinaceae), Notoseris yakoensis (Asteraceae), Clematis (Ranunculaceae), and in the herb layer Asystasia neesiana (Acanthaceae), Ophiorrhiza (Rubiaceae) and Hydrocotyle hookeri (Araliaceae) can be found. 
This ecosystem supports significant numbers of Rufous-necked Hornbill Aceros nipalensis (VU) as well as widespread frugivores such as Great Barbet Psilopogon virens, Gold-whiskered Barbet Psilopogon chrysopogon and Blue-throated Barbet Psilopogon asiaticus. There is also a growing diversity of Bush-warblers (Scotocercidae), Old World Warblers and Parrotbills (Sylviidae), Scimitar-babblers and allies (Timaliidae) and Laughingthrushes and allies (Leiotrichidae) which continue to higher elevations. 
Mammals in this ecosystem include significant populations of Shortridge's Langur Trachypithecus shortridgei (EN), Stump-tailed Macaque Macaca arctoides (VU), Assamese Macaque Macaca assamensis (NT), Eastern Hoolock Gibbon Hoolock leuconedys (VU), Dhole Cuon alpinus (EN), Sun Bear Helarctos malayanus (VU), Himalayan Black Bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), Mainland Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa (VU) and Leaf Muntjac Muntiacus putaoensis (DD).
Abiotic environment
Warm temperate rainforests are defined by an overall water surplus with no distinct dry season and rarely experience frosts. Moisture is mostly retained and, although there are distinct winter and growing seasons, the growing season persists for 6 to 8 months of the year.


Key processes and interactions
High rainfall promotes a moisture rich environment that is not fire prone. The closed-canopy forest assists in maintaining moisture into the dry season.

Bamboo brakes are dense, thicket ecosystems dominated by bamboos and with few other trees. Mountain bamboo brake in Myanmar occurs in the north-east, where it occurs together with mountain hardwood forests at mid-high altitudes. Bamboo brake is often considered to occur in response to significant forest disturbances such as shifting cultivation, deforestation or changed fire regimes. However, in Myanmar the first descriptions of these ecosystems arose around 100 years ago (such as Stamp, 1924b), suggesting they may occur naturally in areas where they are able to supress the growth of broadleaf woody vegetation. Despite extensive literature searches, no further descriptions were found and there is therefore considerable uncertainty about the distribution, species diversity and change of this ecosytem. 
Distribution
Mountain bamboo brake occurs in the north-east, primarily in association with wet mountain hardwood forest, particularly in very steep areas that cannot develop larger forests (World Heritage nomination). No map data is available for this ecosystem type in Myanmar, however, patches of Dendrocalamus strictus forest are mapped in China around 800 – 1,000 m altitude immediately north of Shan state (EVCMC-CAS, 2007) 
Characteristic native biota
Very little is known about this ecosystem, and no recorded descriptions were found despite extensive literature reviews. Several species of bamboo are known to occur, including Arundinaria spp. and Dendrocalamus strictus. Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens) are closely associated with mountain bamboo brake, occurring above around 2,500 m. 



Abiotic environment
Occurs primarily in wet, high mountain regions which receive considerable rainfall during the monsoon period (probably >6,000 mm). 
Key processes and interactions
Mountain bamboo brake is thought to occur where high annual precipitation (>5,000-6,000 mm) complex topography, strong winds and seismic activity give rise to periodic mass movement (landslides) and disturbance of mountain hardwood forest. This opens up patches of forest and initiates successional processes, where mountain bamboo brake can quickly establish and may remain stable for many years.
Major threats
This ecosystem type may be threatened by deforestation. However, its location in remote high mountain regions where deforestation remains rare suggests this ecosystem is not subject to any major threats at this time.",10,"T2.4","Warm temperate laurophyll forests","With a patchy warm-temperate distribution, laurophyll forests are extensive in some regions, but more typically occupy topographic refugia in a matrix of drier, more fire-prone ecosystems.

An open-canopy savanna with mostly deciduous phenology that occurs in lowland coastal areas along the eastern foothills of the Rakhine Hills. This area undergoes an annual seasonally dry period, typically extending up to 7 months between November to May each year, followed by monsoonal rains (Platt et al., 2010). Rainfall is typically around 850 to 1,250 mm, potentially up to 1,500 mm, and local elevation, fire frequency and moisture gradients are likely the principal factors that influence the distribution of this ecosystem (Wolfhart et al., 2014) It co-occurs with Rakhine hills semi-evergreen dry forest, which tends to occur at higher elevations (sometimes extending to the coastal plain) and is distinguished by the higher abundance of evergreen species, lack of a grassy ground layer and higher overall species diversity. 
Distribution
Distributed throughout the eastern coastal lowlands and hills that fringe the Rakhine hills (Davis, 1960). 
Characteristic native biota
Very little information was found on the characteristic biota of this ecosystem type. The largely deciduous tree canopy is 10 – 15 m tall and varies from less than 10% cover when defoliated in the dry season up to 80% in the wet season. Deciduous tree species are dominant. The main species include ironwood, Taku, Pin-ma, Didu bin and Lannea coromandelica (Anacardiaceae). Vines such as naughty monkey sprawl through the ground layer and into the tree canopies. The ground layer includes grasses, notably Myauk, Hlode (Kress et al., 2003). 
  
The avifauna supports a range of widespread species including Chestnut-headed Bee-eater Merops leschenaultia, Lineated Barbet Psilopogon lineatus, Red-breasted Parakeet Psittacula alexandri (NT), Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria (NT) and Purple Sunbird Cinnyris asiaticus. Mammals in this ecosystem include Golden Jackal Canis aureus and Red Muntjac Muntiacus muntjac.
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs on shallow stony soils on rises, ridges and dry slopes where mean annual rainfall is around 850 to 1,250 mm (Kress, 2003). It occurs in areas that experience a seasonally dry period (monthly rainfall 0-100 mm) of around seven months from early November to late May, followed by several months of monsoonal rains (Platt et al., 2010). Mean annual temperature is warm (25.8 °C) with little variability throughout the year. Fire is likely frequent and lit by humans farming adjacent lands.
Key processes and interactions
Seasonal water availability is the key driver of the dynamics of this dry forest ecosystem (Ashton and Seidler, 2014; Banda et al., 2016). A large seasonal water deficit from November to May drives deciduous phenology of trees and vines. The availability of water is mainly driven by the monsoonal climate, but may also include an edaphic component, with wide variation in soil type and topography likely influencing ecosystem dynamics (Ashton and Seidler, 2014). The amount and timing of monsoonal rains determine annual flushes of productivity in vegetation. Regular fires may be a key element that excludes semi-evergreen elements from establishing (Ashton and Seidler, 2014). In sheltered gullies, the water deficit is less severe, vegetation is less fire prone, and the savanna is replaced by semi-evergreen dry forest.
Major threats
The ecosystem has been widely cleared and fragmented across the coastal lowlands for the development of rice paddies and, to a lesser extent, shifting agriculture. It has also been a source of wood for construction and domestic fuel. Ingress of livestock occurs from adjacent farmland, with associated impacts of selective grazing, soil compaction and erosion. Changing fire regimes, particularly near villages or farms where fires may be suppressed, could also threaten this ecosystem by allowing the encroachment of upslope semi-evergreen forests.",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence.

This ecosystem is a grassy open woodland dominated by Tectona hamiltoniana (dahat) and Terminalia oliveri (than) that occurs throughout the rolling hills of the dry zone, corresponding to community types 1-7 of Oo and Koike (2015). The presence of dry clay soils is thought to be the key driver of its distribution (Davis, 1960). Trees in Than-Dahat grassy forests are rarely greater than 10 metres tall, and have a fairly sparse, open, distribution, as is characteristic of a savanna. A thick ground cover of grasses is present, and bamboo may occur (Oo and Koike, 2015). Mostly deciduous with C4 grassy groundcover (Ratnam et al., 2016). Two other isolated Than-Dahat ecosystems fringe the central dry zone in Myanmar. 
Distribution
Restricted to the central dry zone of Myanmar, primarily on low rolling hills where soil type and monsoonal patterns of rainfall patterns are sufficient to support a savanna ecosystem. Note that there remains uncertainty in the distribution of this ecosystem, and our map may overpredict Central Ayeyarwady Than-Dahat grassy forest in hillier terrain.
Characteristic native biota
Than-Dahat dry grassy forests have an open tree canopy dominated by two species, Terminalia oliveri (Combretaceae) and Tectona hamiltoniana (Lamiaceae). They may also include species found in drier areas, such as Acacia catechu (Fabaceae) and patches of bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus, Poaceae). Other tree species include Dalbergia paniculata, Bauhinia racemosa (Fabaceae), Diospyros burmanica 
   
(Ebenaceae), Grewia tilifolia (Malvaceae), Limonia acidissima (Rutaceae) and Shorea siamensis (Davis, 1960; Oo and Koike, 2015). 
The vines Hiptage benghalensis (Malpighiaceae) and Cissampelos pareira (Menispermaceae) grow into the tree canopies and C4 grasses such as Aristida depressa (Poaceae) dominate the understorey with scattered shrubs of Waltheria indica (Malvaceae). This ecosystem is important habitat for endemic and near-endemic birds including Burmese Collared-dove Streptopelia xanthocycla, Jerdon's Minivet Pericrocotus albifrons (NT), Hooded Treepie Crypsirina cucullate (NT) Burmese Bushlark Mirafra microptera, Burmese Prinia Prinia cooki, Ayeyarwady Bulbul Pycnonotus blanfordi and White-throated Babbler Chatarrhaea gularis. It also supports remnant populations of the Endangered Eld’s Deer Rucervus eldii (EN); (Thu et al., 2019) and Burmese Star Tortoise Geochelone platynota (CR).
Abiotic environment
Mean annual rainfall of between about 800 mm and 1,000 mm (Stamp, 1924b; Khaine et al., 2017). A seasonally dry period occurs from October to late May. Temperatures are hot with little seasonal variation. Generally, occurs on clays (such as Peguan Clay) and dry soils, mostly on low rolling rises and foothills. 
Key processes and interactions
The interaction of rainfall, soil type and the presence of fire are important in maintaining this ecosystem. The amount and very strong seasonality of monsoonal rains determine annual flushes of productivity in vegetation punctuated by prolonged water deficit over the dry season (Khaine et al., 2017). Most of the trees are equipped with thick bark enabling survival through recurring surface fires that consume the grassy groundcover when it cures in the dry season. The native vegetation is well adapted to fire, quickly resprouting while other woody species fail to establish. 
Major threats
The ecosystem has been extensively fragmented by conversion to agriculture and the remnants are harvested for firewood and other human uses (Davis, 1960). Most fragments are highly degraded due to overgrazing and earthworks (e.g. quarrying or roads).",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence.

An open woodland with conspicuous tall palms, Borassus flabellifer, (“Taung-on”) up to 30 m tall, and distinctively white-trunked trees of Acacia leucophloea (“Htanaung”) that grow up to 10-12 m tall occur in the driest climates of the central Myanmar plains. A ground layer comprises C4 grasses, sedges and forbs that become lush in response to monsoon rains. It co-occurs with Sha thorn scrub, which occurs on drier sites and is distinguished by the absence of palms and drier, more open ground layer vegetation. No remnant patches of this ecosystem were identified in the assessment, despite extensive field traverses, only relic trees and small plantations were observed.
Distribution
Although this ecosystem has never been mapped, fieldwork by the authors suggest that it was restricted to the central dry zone.
Characteristic native biota
There is very little information on the native plants and animals of this ecosystem. Borassus flabellifer (Arecaceae), Acacia leucophloea and Acacia catechu (Fabaceae) are the dominant trees, but some stands also have broad-leaved trees. The ground layer is highly disturbed by grazing and cultivation. It is dominated by introduced plants but likely to include native hydrophytic grasses, sedges and forbs, including Paspalum, Isachne, Oryza (Poaceae), Carex, Cyperus (Cyperaceae) and Persicaria (Polygonaceae). This ecosystem once supported endemic and near-endemic birds including Burmese Collared-dove Streptopelia xanthocycla, Jerdon's Minivet Pericrocotus albifrons (NT), Hooded Treepie Crypsirina cucullate (NT) Burmese Bushlark Mirafra microptera, Burmese Prinia Prinia cooki, Ayeyarwady Bulbul Pycnonotus blanfordi and White-throated Babbler Chatarrhaea gularis. The system probably supported an assemblage of large herbivores (e.g. cervids, rhinoceros, elephants) and their predators (tigers and smaller felines). 
Abiotic environment
Mean annual rainfall is 700 - 1000 mm, with a regular seasonal drought from October to late May when monsoonal rains arrive. Palm savannas occur on flat terrain in low-lying areas that remain saturated in the monsoon season and may retain shallow surface water after deluges. Temperatures are hot, with little seasonal variation. The soils are depositional and fine-textured loams. They may be deep and have an appreciable organic content. 
Key processes and interactions
Rainfall gradients define the distribution of this ecosystem in the rain shadow of Myanmar’s central Ayeyarwady valley. The amount and timing of monsoonal rains determine annual flushes of productivity in ground layer vegetation. Grazing by native megafauna may have been important in the dynamics of groundlayer vegetation in historical times. Domestic cattle are now the principle herbivores. Surface movement and slow drainage of water seems critical to the ecology of the ground flora and fauna.  
Major threats
This ecosystem has been transformed, almost in its entirety, to dry agriculture for beans and pulses, irrigated rice paddies and grazing pastures. Relictual palms and Acacias remain, but these species are also actively planted on roadsides and paddy boundaries, making the distribution difficult to interpret. The ground vegetation has been largely replaced by exotic crops and pastures, and is very poorly known. Alteration to surface water flows with small levees and application of fertilisers are likely to adversely affect remaining flora and fauna.",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence.

Shwe Settaw Sha-Bamboo thicket occurs as a dense bamboo-dominated ecosystem distributed along the foothills of the Magway hills. It is dominated by thickets of narrow leaf bamboo (probably Bambusa tulda and Dendrocalalmus strictus) and Acacia catechu (Sha) (Platt et al., 2011). Some deciduous and evergreen species may be scattered through the thicket. Although ecosystem processes are largely unknown, fire is likely present and a key driver of the distribution of this ecosystem type.
Distribution
Occurs in narrow bands along the foothills of the Magway hills, and may have once had a broad distribution across the dry zone (Platt et al., 2011).
Characteristic native biota
This ecosystem consists primarily of dense thickets of bamboo (probably Dendrocalamus strictus, Poaceae) with Sha (Acacia catechu, Fabaceae). There is usually a heavy groundcover of leaf litter and interspersed with scattered grasses and forbs. These thickets are important sheltering habitat for populations of the

It also supports remnant populations of the Endangered Eld’s Deer Rucervus eldii (EN); (Thu et al., 2019) and Burmese Star Tortoise Geochelone platynota (CR).

 
 
Abiotic environment
Mean annual rainfall of between up to 1,400 mm delivered during the monsoon, with a strong seasonally dry period from October to late May. Temperatures remain hot throughout the year. 
Key processes and interactions
It is possible that these thickets become established after major canopy fires or perhaps major storms that create large gaps in broad-leaf forests, allowing bamboos to establish in high densities. Secondary bamboo thickets may be established by human activities associated with shifting cultivation and burning, but these are dominated by opportunistic colonists and may lack the diversity exhibited by ‘natural’ thickets. Once established, high densities of bamboo and associated litter layers may limit the establishment of broad-leaved trees. Over decadal time scales, these may eventually become established and reach the canopy, however, recurring fires (ground or canopy) may reset this process. Many of the bamboo taxa undergo mast flowering, which may be important in fuelling interannual bursts of productivity Throughout the trophic web.
Major threats
The threats to Shwe Settaw Sha-Bamboo thicket are cutting bamboo, collecting fuelwood and grazing cattle (Platt et al., 2011). Bamboos are also often cut for roofing, house construction, fencing, agricultural implements (Thaung et al., 2006). However, these threats appear to be localised or of low severity. Regular fires in surrounding savanna ecosystems may also occasionally threaten this ecosystem, but the fire responses are not well understood and probably vary between bamboo species.",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence.

Magway Than-Dahat grassy forest is an open woodland dominated by Tectona hamiltoniana (dahat) and Terminalia oliveri (than; Stamp, 1924a; Davis, 1960). This ecosystem occurs along the western margin of the dry zone, primarily on clay soils along the foothills of Magway state. The sparse canopy of Than-Dahat is around 10 metres tall, and a ground cover of grasses is present. Bamboo thickets may occur, particularly in moister areas or fringing the surrounding Shwe Settaw Sha-Bamboo Thicket ecosystem. Mostly deciduous with a largely continuous ground layer of C4 grasses. Two other Than-Dahat ecosystems occur to the east in the central and eastern dry zone.
Distribution
Occurs along the foothills of the Rakhine and Magway hills, where it forms mosaics with drier non-grassy ecosystems such as Magway semi-evergreen dry gully forest and Shwe Settaw Sha-Bamboo thicket. Bounded to the East by Chindwin River.
Characteristic native biota
Main woody species are Terminalia oliveri (Dahat) (Combretaceae) and Tectona hamiltoniana (Than) (Lamiaceae). Other trees include Phyllanthus emblica (ziphyu) (Phyllanthaceae), Lannea coromandelica (nabe) (Anacardiaceae), Bombax insigne (didu) (Malvaceae), Grewia tiliifolia (tayaw) (Malvaceae), Santalum album (Santalaceae), Markhamia stipulata (Bignoniaceae), Dalbergia paniculata, Delonix regia, Acacia catechu (sha) (Fabaceae), and Chukrasia tabularis (Meliaceae),. Vines such as Morinda tinctoria (ny-pa-syr) (Rubiaceae) are occasionally found in the ground layer or may ascend into the tree canopies. 
  
The continuous grassy ground layer includes several abundant C4 grass taxa; Themeda triandra (myat-swele), Polytoca wallichiana (na-yar-myat), Cymbopogon virgatus (myat-nam), Cyrtococcum patens (pa-taw-myet) and Aristida spp. (Poaceae). This ecosystem may also include bamboo thickets in moister gullies (Dendrocalamus strictus) (Poaceae) and some incursion of dry deciduous species from surrounding ecosystems (Oo and Koike, 2015). This ecosystem is important habitat for endemic and near-endemic birds including Burmese Collared-dove Streptopelia xanthocycla, Jerdon's Minivet Pericrocotus albifrons (NT), Hooded Treepie Crypsirina cucullate (NT) Burmese Bushlark Mirafra microptera, Burmese Prinia Prinia cooki, Ayeyarwady Bulbul Pycnonotus blanfordi and White-throated Babbler Chatarrhaea gularis. It also supports remnant populations of the Endangered Eld’s Deer Rucervus eldii (EN); (Thu et al., 2019) and Burmese Star Tortoise Geochelone platynota (CR). Termite mounds are relatively common
Abiotic environment
Mean annual rainfall of between about 800 mm and 1,000 mm (Stamp, 1924b). Occurs in fire-prone hills and slopes, but generally not in sheltered gullies. A seasonally dry period occurs from October to late May when monsoonal rains arrive, and temperatures are hot, with little seasonal variation. Generally, occurs on clays and dry soils, mostly on low rolling rises and foothills. Distribution is largely a result of the occurrence of dry soil types, and precipitation patterns.
Key processes and interactions
Rainfall gradients and soil type defines the distribution of this ecosystem. A strong seasonal water deficit drives the annual growth flush and curing of the C4 grass layer, as well as growth and defoliation of deciduous tree canopies that characterise this system. As a pyric savanna ecosystem, fire plays a key role in structuring the vegetation, maintaining tree/grass coexistence and supressing the establishment of trees from surrounding dry gully forests and bamboo thickets (Ratnam et al., 2011). Large herbivores would have once been quite abundant in the past prior to habitat loss and overexploitation. Termites continue to play significant roles in cycling of organic matter and nutrients.
Major threats
Changed fire regimes, which in some areas are burnt annually, can destroy natural vegetation cover (Thu et al., 2019). Deforestation for cultivation and firewood also occurs, exacerbating legacies of past fragmentation.",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence.

A sparse woodland of Acacia catechu (""sha""), that varies in form from low bushes (1 to 2 m tall) to small trees (<8 m tall) is distinctive of the driest climates in Myanmar in the centre of the country. A mixed ground layer comprises low thorny shrubs, occasional forbs and wiry C4 grasses, with frequent patches of bare ground. The height and density of trees and ground layer vegetation varies with rainfall, microtopography and soil texture and depth.  It co-occurs with Central Ayeyarwady Palm Savanna, which occurs in lower lying areas and is distinguished by the presence of tall palms and more lush ground layer vegetation.
Distribution
Restricted to the central Ayeyarwady dry zone (Davis, 1960). 
Characteristic native biota
Acacia catechu (Fabaceae) is the widespread dominant tree. Zizyphus jujube (Rhamnaceae), succulent Euphorbia antiquorum (Euphorbiaceae), and other thorny shrubs are scattered throughout. Other woody plants include Tectona hamiltoniana (Lamiaceae) (bushes often to 1 m high), Miliusa velutina (Annonaceae), Limonia acidissima (Rutaceae), Carissa spinarum (Apocynaceae), Azima sarmentosa (Salvadoraceae), Capparis spinosum, C. zeylanica (Capparaceae), Phyllanthus reticulatus (Phyllanthaceae), Vitex negundo (Lamiaceae), Boerhavia sp.(Nyctaginaceae), Combretum latifolium (Combretaceae) and Vallaris solanacea (Apocynaceae) and scattered trees of Hypselandra variabilis (""thamon"") (Capparaceae). C4 grasses, notably Dichanthium foveolatum, Tragus racemosus, Digitaria setigera, Aristida spp. Enteropogon spp., and Themeda triandra 
   
(Poaceae) dominate the ground layer, but cover depends on grazing pressure and recent rainfall, and large patches of bare soil are common. Herbaceous plants with rosette growth forms (e.g., Tridax procumbens, Asteraceae) are scattered through the ground layer.
This ‘dry savanna’ system probably supported an assemblage of large herbivores (e.g. cervids, rhinoceros, elephants) and their predators (tigers and smaller felines), which are now replaced by domestic cattle. Introduced plants species such as Bursera spp. (Burseraceae) Jatropha gossypifolia and Euphorbia neriifolia (Euphorbiaceae) occur in some of the remnants.
This ecosystem is important habitat for endemic and near-endemic birds including Burmese Collared-dove Streptopelia xanthocycla, Jerdon's Minivet Pericrocotus albifrons (NT), Hooded Treepie Crypsirina cucullate (NT) Burmese Bushlark Mirafra microptera, Burmese Prinia Prinia cooki, Ayeyarwady Bulbul Pycnonotus blanfordi and White-throated Babbler Chatarrhaea gularis. It also supports remnant populations of the Endangered Eld’s Deer Rucervus eldii (EN); (Thu et al., 2019) and Burmese Star Tortoise Geochelone platynota (CR).
Abiotic environment
Mean annual rainfall may be as low as 700 mm, and no more than 1,000 mm. A regular rainless period extends from October, reaching a peak in late May when monsoonal rains arrive. Temperatures are hot, with little seasonal variation. Sha thorny scrub is closely associated with the dry typically gypseous ""Peguan"" loams but also extends onto the Ayeyarwady sands. It occurs on flat terrain on low rises and other sites that drain relatively freely in the wet season. 
Key processes and interactions
Rainfall gradients define the distribution of this ecosystem in the rain shadow of Myanmar’s central Ayeyarwady valley. The amount and timing of monsoonal rains determine annual flushes of productivity in vegetation and the appearance and abundance of some of the component ground layer plants. Plants and animals have varied life history, morphological and ecophysiological traits for persistence through seasonal drought, including deep roots architecture, C4 photosynthetic pathways, succulent tissues and thermoregulatory behaviour.
Grazing and fire regimes shape the composition and structure of the vegetation. Prior to human occupation a diverse assemblage of megafauna is likely to have driven top-down ecosystem regulation. These animals were extirpated as human land use intensified in the region, and domestic cattle now graze in a more intense and sedentary grazing regime unregulated by predators.
Major threats
The ecosystem has been highly fragmented by intensive agricultural land uses (cattle grazing and some cropping; Ashton 2014). Only very small patches remain and these are in varying states of degradation due to overgrazing, legacies of past ploughing or earthworks (e.g. quarrying or roads) and invasions of exotic species. Recurring fires potentially threaten the persistence of succulent elements such as Euphorbia spp.",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence.

Shan foothills Than-Dahat grassy forest is an open woodland dominated by Tectona hamiltoniana (Dahat) and Terminalia oliveri (Than). This ecosystem occurs around the eastern margin of the central dry zone, particularly on clay soils that form in the foothills of the Shan Hills (Davis, 1960). Trees in Than-Dahat grassy forests are rarely greater than 10 metres tall, and have an open semi-continuous canopy that defoliates in the dry season. An open shrub layer and semi-continuous ground cover of C4 grasses is present, and bamboo may occur (Oo and Koike, 2015). Two other Than-Dahat ecosystems are recognised to occur around the fringes of the central dry zone in Myanmar. All Than-Dahat ecosystems in Myanmar have been subject to extensive fragmentation as a result of human population growth and conversion of dry zone ecosystems to agriculture.

Termites also play a role in cycling of organic material and nutrients. 
Major threats
Widespread cutting for fuel and uses in machinery remains one of the major threats to this ecosystem. Earthworks and clearing for infrastructure such as roads occur throughout its range.

Pine savanna is an open to closed evergreen needleleaf savanna ecosystem that occurs in four to five regions across Myanmar, with each currently being a separate ecosystem given geographical barriers between them. Further investigation is needed to identify the major features that distinguish these regional variants. Shan hills pine savanna can be found in the rolling hills of Shan State and extends into western Thailand and southern China (ECVMC-CAS, 2007). The ecosystem tends to occur on hill tops, where it is more exposed to drying than surrounding evergreen or semi-evergreen forests.  Pines have a grassy understory, and require fire for natural regeneration, and can be invaded from other forest types when fire is suppressed (Ratnam et al., 2016). In many areas Shan hills pine savanna may be a secondary forest with canopy <15 m (Several similar pine savannas occur throughout Myanmar, including in the Chin Hills, Sagaing Region and Kachin State. 
Distribution
Shan hills pine savanna occurs throughout Shan State, where it is patchily distributed across the hilly plateau at elevations over about 1,200 m (Collet, 1890), such as around Kalaw, and up to about 2,000 m near Taungyii. We were unable to visit the east and northeastern parts of Shan State during fieldwork, so we are unable to confirm this ecosystem in these inaccessible regions. The China vegetation map (ECVMC-CAS, 2007) suggests this ecosystem may not be as extensive in the north of Shan as depicted by our models.
Characteristic native biota
Shan hills pine savanna has a open tree canopy dominated by near-monotypic stands of Pinus species, which hare probably Pinus merkusii or Pinus kesiya (Pinaceae). 
  
Field work could not be conducted in this region to identify the primary species of Pinus. Canopy height may approach around 30 m, although there is considerable variation with local climate and soil conditions. (Ashton, 2014). Hardwoods are near absent, although may occur where the savanna ecosystem meets surrounding evergreen forests, which is normally associated with wetter gullies, or hardwood forest at greater elevations. The ground layer is characterised by a semi-continuous cover of tussock grasses.
Abiotic environment
Pine savanna is found at moderate altitudes across the Shan Plateau (1,200-2,000 m above sea level). In these areas temperatures are typically more exposed and drier than surrounding areas, and likely receive rainfall typically greater than 1,000 mm per annum. They occur on low-nutrient and well-draining soils such as sand or loam (Davis, 1960). 
Key processes and interactions
Pine savanna ecosystems are thought to be maintained by fire (Ratnam et al., 2016; Van Zonneveld et al., 2009). The ground layer is dominated by fire-adapted tussock grasses and characteristic pine trees that are well adapted to surviving both low and high intensity fires because their thick bark insulates vital meristematic and vascular tissues and the canopies of mature trees are generally above scorch height (Ratnam et al., 2016). Where fires are rare or supressed, pine savanna ecosystems may be invaded by hardwood forest species from surrounding ecosystems.
Major threats
Threats to this ecosystem include deforestation for slash and burn agriculture (Tun, 2016), felling for firewood, and fire suppression (Farjon, 2019, Ratnam et al., 2016, Van Zonneveld et al., 2009).

Pine savannas are grassy ecosystems with open to closed evergreen needleleaf tree canopies. They occur in four to five regions across Myanmar, with each currently recogised as a separate ecosystem type, subject to further research on geographical barriers to dispersal of biota. Chin Hills pine savanna occurs patchily at higher altitudes along the western border of Myanmar. The ecosystem is dominated by Pinus kesiya (Khasia Pine), with a canopy height up to around 30 metres, and a grass-dominated understorey (Davis, 1960). It is thought to occur in seasonally dry habitats on well-drained soil between about 800 m and 1,500 m (Davis, 1960, Farjon, 2013). 
Distribution
Chin Hills pine savanna occurs along the Chin Hills in western Myanmar, where it is patchily distributed along the range between around 800 to 1,500 m (Davis, 1960) and perhaps up to 2,000 m (Farjon, 2013). 
Characteristic native biota
This ecosystem is dominated by near-monotypic stands of Khasia Pine, Pinus kesiya (Pinaceae), local name Tinyu. The ecosystem is generally less biodiverse than surrounding hardwood forests. Hardwoods are mostly absent, although mixed stands with Quercus (Fagaceae), Shorea and Dipterocarpus (Dipterocarpaceae) can occur, particularly in the absence of fire (Davis, 1960). The understorey is dominated by a mixture of C4 and C3 grass species with small forbs. Shrubs are sparse. Several near-endemic and endemic taxa of birds range between Rhododendron (Ericaceae), Quercus (Fagaceae) and Pinus (Pinaceae). 
  
Mrs Hume's Pheasant Syrmaticus humiae (NT), Black-bibbed Tit Poecile hypermelaenus, Yellow-billed Blue Magpie Urocissa flavirostris and Yellow-breasted Greenfinch Chloris spinoides are often seen in this habitat but only the local subspecies of Bar-tailed Treecreeper Certhia himalayan ripponi is actually restricted to mature pines (Harrap 2019).
Abiotic environment
The Chin Hills pine savanna is found at altitudes of 800 – 1,500 m, possibly up to 2,000 m, where temperatures are cooler than on adjacent lowlands where other savanna ecosystems occur. They occur on low-nutrient and well-draining soils with sandy or loamy texture (Davis, 1960). Rainfall is typically greater than 1,000 mm per annum and highly seasonal due to the monsoons. 
Key processes and interactions
Pine savanna ecosystems are thought to be maintained by fire (Ratnam et al., 2016; Van Zonneveld et al., 2009). The ground layer is dominated by fire-adapted grasses, which propagate fire when they cure in the dry season. The characteristic pines survive low and relatively high intensity fires due to their thick bark, which insulates sensitive cambial and vascular tissues form fire temperatures (Ratnam et al., 2016). Most broad-leaf tree species lack such traits, and have lower survival rates post-fire. Where fires are rare or supressed, Asian pine savanna ecosystems tend to be invaded by hardwood forest species from surrounding ecosystems.
Major threats
Threats to this ecosystem include deforestation for agriculture, felling for firewood, and fire suppression (Farjon, 2013, Ratnam et al., 2016, Van Zonneveld et al., 2009).

Sagaing hills pine savanna is an open evergreen needleleaf savanna ecosystem that occurs across the Sagaing hills. It has a non-continous canopy primarily of Pinus kesiya (Khasia Pine) and a grassy understory. Fire is a key process that maintains the ecosystem, serving to suppress the incursion of surrounding hardwood forest ecosystems. Examples of this ecosystem can be found in Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park. Several similar pine savannas occur throughout Myanmar, including in the Chin Hills, Shan Region and Kachin State.

Key processes and interactions
Pine savanna ecosystems are thought to be maintained by periodic fire (Ratnam et al., 2016; Van Zonneveld et al., 2009). The ground layer is dominated by fire-adapted grasses and characteristic pine species are well adapted to surviving both low and high intensity fires (Ratnam et al., 2016). Thick bark protects the living stem tissues of pines enabling them to survive fires, so long as most of the canopy is not scorched.

Kingdon- Ward (1945) suggests that this might be a sub-component of the Kachin sub-tropical rainforest as it is sometimes found intermixed with that rain forest ecosystem type found within the gullies and the savanna likely occupy more fire-prone ridges and drier south facing hill sides. This savanna ecosystem relies on periodic fire to maintain open conditions suitable for recruitment of pine seedlings, and. There is similar pine savanna found in other regions within the country and in neighbouring countries. There are few epiphytes.
Distribution
Kachin pine savanna is scattered in very small patches in northern Kachin state, typically between about 1,000 to 2,000 m in elevation. It also occurs in surrounding countries to the south-east (Ratnam et al., 2016). Considerable uncertainty remains in the distribution of this ecosystem due to a lack of access, so further work (including field work) is recommended to refine the distribution map of this ecosystem type.
Characteristic native biota
The trees include pines particularly Pinus species (either P yunnanensis or P. kesiya, Pinaceae). These forests are very poorly known in Myanmar and the dominant pine species needs further investigation (K. Tomlinson pers. comm.). In adjacent areas of China, Pinus yunnanesis is mapped with Lithocarpus truncatus  Quercus monimotricha (Fagaceae) and Schima wallichii (Theaceae) (ECVMC-CAS, 2007). 
 
In Myanmar, pine savannas may also include oaks Quercus may also include oaks Quercus incana, Q. serrata and Q. griffithi (Fagaceae); with shrubs including Pieris ovalifolia (Ericaceae), Wendlandia speciosa (Rubiaceae), Vernonia clivorum and V. adenophylla (the latter semi-scandent) (Asteraceae), Dipentodon sinicus (Dipentodonaceae), Gaultheria grifjithiana and G. yunnanensis (Ericaceae), Litsea euosma, L. moupinensis and L. forrestii (Lauraceae).
Abiotic environment
Kachin pine savanna is found predominantly on south facing slopes and sandy soils between around 700-2,000 m with a mainly sub-tropical climate.
Key processes and interactions
Periodic fire is important in maintaining the grassy character of this ecosystem and the dominance of pines. Thick bark protects the living stem tissues of pines enabling them to survive fires, so long as most of the canopy is not scorched. Without fire, it is likely that recruitment and establishment of broad-leaf evergreen trees will increase canopy cover, reduce light penetration and drying in the ground layer and promote transition to warm temperate rainforest
The pine savannas are likely to provide open habitat for birds, ground mammals and invertebrates that are not common in rainforests.
Major threats
The main threats likely include fire exclusion, frequent fire regimes, shifting cultivation, infrastructure development and possibly grazing (Ratnam et al., 2016). However, none of these are currently severe or extensive.",23,"T4.2","Pyric tussock savannas","In pyric savannas, recurring fire is the principal agent that limits tree dominance and maintains tree-grass coexistence. Dominated by tussock grasses that grow tall during high-productivity wet summers and cure over dry winter seasons, these ecosystems occur on all major land masses at tropical and subtropical latitudes around the world. Large mammalian herbivores are usually present, but not at densities that limit grass growth or mediate tree-grass coexistence (unlike T4.1). Many plants have traits that promote tolerate of seasonal drought, such as deciduous leaf phenology, subterranean storage organs and deep roots.

Very poorly known grasslands apparently existed on the limestones of the Shan Plateau 100 years ago when they were described by Stamp (1924b). Consistent with grasslands recorded in analogous environments in other parts of the world, Shan plateau grasslands likely occurred on heavy-textured soils in topographic depressions that receive cold air drainage from surrounding hills rising well above 1000 m elevation. Although limestone areas on the Shan plateau occur at subtropical latitudes, the temperatures may resemble those of temperate climates due to the elevation and cold air drainage. Owing to travel restrictions, it is not possible to provide a photo or accurate distribution map for this ecosystem.
Distribution
Poorly known but apparently restricted to undulating limestone landscapes on the Shan plateau. No distribution map is available for this ecosystem, although it is expected to occur across Shan State.
Characteristic native biota
The biota is very poorly known, but vegetation is likely to have been dominated by a mixture of C3 and C4 tussock grasses with interstitial forbs in plant taxa such as Asteraceae, Ranuncuaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Convolvulaceae, Lamiaceae, Onagraeae, Liliales (including Orchidaceae), Junaceae and Cyperaceae. The biota is likely to have included large herbivores such as deer (Cervidae), Rhinoceros, Elephant, and their predators including Tiger and other felines. 
Abiotic environment
Mild to cool temperatures and moderate to high precipitation, including occasional snow. Likely to have occurred on heavy-textured clay alkaline soils derived from limestone in low-relief topographic depressions and valleys.
Key processes and interactions
Grazing and recurring fires are likely to have been important in maintaining the open grassy structure of this ecosystem. 
Major threats
Conversion to crops and pastures is the major threat, as well as hunting of vertebrate fauna.",26,"T4.5","Temperate subhumid grasslands","Temperate subhumid grasslands are simple in structure, composed of tussock grasses with scattered forbs, with few isolated trees and shrubs.

Kachin snowfields are characterised by perrenial snow and ice that do not entirely melt over the warmer summer months. They therefore consist of masses of snow and ice that accumulate and compact over many years, but unlike glaciers do not become thick enough to flow with gravity. They are crucial for regulating water availability for ecosystems occuring downstream and at lower altitude. 
Distribution
Kachin snowfields occur in the high mountain northeast region over around 3,750 m. They may fluctuate in distribution slightly between years due to varying climatic conditions. 
Characteristic native biota
There may be some low growing forbs, sedges and grasses at the snow margins. However, owing to a very hostile abiotic environment, the biota of this ecosystem is characterised only by microbial fauna and microscopic algae. Vertebrates such as Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Blue Sheep Pseudois nayaur could be itinerants in this ecosystem but are rarely seen. Snow Leopard Panthera uncia (VU) is the known predator for Blue Sheep so could be an itinerant but there are no confirmed records in Myanmar yet.
Abiotic environment
Persistently very cold with high annual precipitation. Topography is generally flat enough to sustain snow without leading to glacial flow. Owing to lower incident radiation throughout the year, persistent snowfields tend to occur more on poleward (northern) aspects of mountains.


 
Key processes and interactions
Persistent freezing conditions are driven primarily by high altitude, and the distribution of snow may be influenced by fine-scale topographic conditions, such as aspect and gullies.  High winds redistribute surface snow, generally to leeward slopes, before it consolidates as ice.
Major threats
Global warming poses a very serious threat to this ecosystem, which is expected to cause widespread melting of snow patches and will drive a substantial decline of the extent of the ecosystem. Reduced snow cover will result in increased exposure to frosts, making the snowfields less suitable for habitation by biota that shelter from extreme temperatures in voids beneath the snow.",38,"T6.1","Ice sheets, glaciers and perennial snowfields","Found in polar regions and on high mountains, ice sheets, glaciers and perennial snowfields make up around 10% of the earth’s surface.

At the base of simple foodwebs, micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and algae are the dominant life forms, although itinerant vertebrates make important contributions to nutrient and carbon subsidies. Micro-organisms are often dispersed by wind, and accumulate organic matter at the surface, fuelling microbial activity both at the surface, and below the ice. Productivity is restricted to summer months, when migratory birds and mammals visit.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T6.1","ValueToValue",,"Nick_Murray","final",,TRUE,"David_Keith",2.1,NA,NA,"001","0005001"

Alpine cliffs and screes are bare, icy, rocky areas amongst permanent snow fields. Vascular vegetation is low and sparse or absent, and the most common plants are crustose lichens and bryophytes (Keith et al., in review). 
Distribution
This ecosystem occurs on the steep upper slopes of the highest mountain peaks amongst glaciers and permanent snowfields, of northern Myanmar and adjacent countries.
Characteristic native biota
The extreme conditions limit the expression of life in these ecosystems, which are characterised by low species diversity, low biomass and low productivity. Lichens, bryophytes and cyanobacteria are the primary producers that inhabit rock surfaces although non-woody vascular plants may be found in crevices where shallow soil accumulates. Other microbes and a small number of insect species likely perform functions as decomposers and detritivores. No information was found on the identity of species that characterise these assemblages in Myanmar. Tussocks of Diapensia himalaica (Diapensiaceae), Androsace, and primulas, such as the endemic Primula vaginata subsp. eucyclia, and P. agleniana var. thearosa (Primulaceae), and woolly plants such as Saussurea (Asteraceae), as well as cushion-forming plants like Arenaria polytrichoides (Caryophyllaceae) can be found at the highest elevations, growing in scree just below the snow line. 
The ecosystem supports a small range of specialized birds more widespread in southwest china and the Tibetan Plateau including Grandala 
 
 
Grandala coelicolor, Alpine Accentor Prunella collaris, and Red-fronted Rosefinch Carpodacus puniceus one of the world’s highest ranging passerines.
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem is found at very high altitudes (approximately >4,500 m above sea level) and is characterised by extremely steep slopes (50-90°), extreme cold, exposure to high winds and periodic desiccation. Soils are essentially absent due to steep slopes or else skeletal and confined to crevices amongst rock.
Key processes and interactions
Extremely steep slopes promote erosion, prevent soil development and facilitate periodic mass movement through landslides and avalanches which remove living biomass. High altitudes and steep slopes, together with very low temperatures exacerbated by wind chill associated with periodically high velocity winds. Frosts and ice promote weathering through frost heave and limit the inhabitability of rock surfaces. Mutualisms within lichens are important but otherwise biotic interactions are weak. 
Major threats
The most plausible threat is global warming, which may elevate temperatures, alter frequencies of snow cover and desiccation regimes. The magnitude of these changes is uncertain, as is the response of the sparse biota, but is likely to be negligible. If desiccation is significant, however, it could have an impact on the cover of bryophytes and lichen.",39,"T6.2","Polar/alpine cliffs, screes, outcrops and lava flows","Polar-alpine rocky outcrops occur in permanently ice-free areas of polar regions and high mountains.

High mountain scrub is a shrubby formation characterized by a great variety of Rhododendron species from large trees to dwarf undershrubs (comprising 75% of the vegetation), intermixed with other shrubby genera (e.g. Salix, Berberis, Euonymus) and stands of dwarf bamboo. According to Kingdon-Ward (1948) this is a Rhododendron climax formation with more species growing in this zone (20+) than any other of equal depth. There are c.130 species recorded from Myanmar – mostly from the far north with c. 30% being endemic (UNESCO, 2014).
This zone marks the transition between silver fir forest and alpine areas. From just within and extending beyond the silver fir forest, 3-5 m tall tree-like rhododendrons (R. beesianum, often mixed with R. uvariifolium) predominate, giving way to stands of R. praestans and R. selense, a small tree or large bushy shrub growing gregariously, which dominates the scene (Kingdon-Ward, 1944). 
Distribution
This vegetation type occurs in high mountain regions of Northern Kachin State and neighboring Himalayan regions. It is found at elevations of c. 3,400-4,000 m.
Characteristic native biota
According to Kingdon-Ward (1948), typical species of Rhododendron in this zone include R. anthopogon, R. arizelum, R. campylogynum, R. cerasinum, R. chryseum, R. crebreflorum, R. eclecteum, R. hypolepidotum, R. luridum, R. niphargum, R. praestans, R. pruniflorum, R. pumilum, R. repens, R. saluense, R. sanguineum, R. selense, R. tephropeplum, R. trichocladum, R. tsarongense together with endemics such as R. 
  
calostrotum, R. chamaetortum and R. keleticum (Ericaceae). Just twenty-five percent of the woody plants in the high mountain scrub are genera other than Rhododendron. They include Salix (Salicaceae), Spiraea, Cotoneaster, Rosa, Sorbus wardii (Rosaceae), Ribes (Grossulariaceae), Viburnum, (Adoxaceae), Lonicera (Caprifoliaceae), Berberis burmanica (Berberidaceae), Euonymus (Celastraceae), Ilex (Aquifoliaceae), Vaccinium, Gaultheria minuata, Cassiope (Ericaceae), and Juniperus (Cupressaceae). On exposed mountain ridges, dense stands of dwarf bamboo also occur. Herbs growing amongst the shrubs include Codonopsis (Campanulaceae) Euphorbia sikkimensis (Euphorbiaceae) and Gentiana (Gentianaceae). 
This ecosystem supports Himalayan Monal Lophophorus impejanus, Temminck's Tragopan Tragopan temminckii, Blood Pheasant Ithaginis cruentus;  a wide range of palearctic tits including Coal Tit Periparus ater, Rufous-vented Tit Periparus rubidiventris, Grey-crested Tit Lophophanes dichrous as well as breeding Leaf-warblers (Phylloscopidae), Old World Warblers and Parrotbills (Sylviidae), Fire-tailed Myzornis Myzornis pyrrhoura, White-eyes and Yuhinas (Zosteropidae), and Alpine Thrush Zoothera mollissima.There are also significant populations of high-elevation mammals including Red Panda Ailurus fulgens (EN), Takin Budorcas taxicolor (VU), Red Goral Naemorhedus baileyi (VU) and Moupin Pika Ochotona thibetana.
Abiotic environment
High mountain scrub occurs between the seasonal and permanent snowlines, where winter temperatures fall well below 0°C, often on steep and/or rocky areas.
Key processes and interactions
A minimal growing season of three months enables recruitment and slow growth of shrubs and low trees. Heavy snowfalls may occur in winter and, with wind shear, limit the stature of woody vegetation. Birds migrate to lower elevations in winter, while mammals, such as Himalayan mammoths, and invertebrates hibernate among rocks.

Alpine herbfield is one of the rarest ecosystems in Myanmar, occurring from c. 3,500-4,200 m in steep mountainous areas of Kachin State, where snow persists into the growing season (i.e. April-May). This ecosystem is of outstanding integrity and represents some of the only undisturbed or lightly disturbed alpine vegetation of this size in the Himalaya (UNESCO, 2014).The flora is of Sino-Himalayan origin, and is comprised of herbaceous plants, which form alpine meadows interspersed with patches of matted Rhododendron and other prostrate Ericaceae (e.g. Cassiope) 
Distribution
This ecosystem occurs below the permanent snowline in the high-altitude areas of northern Myanmar and adjacent countries. 
Characteristic native biota
Alpine herbfield can be found at 3,500 m and above. Characteristic herbaceous plants in this ecosystem include numerous species of Primula, such as P. serratifolia, P. capitata, P. triloba, P. dickieana, P. chamaethauma, and P. fea as well as Omphalogramma souliei (Primulaceae), various gentian species, including Gentiana wardii and Gentiana sino-ornata (Gentianaceae), Cremanthodium, Lactuca, the woolly Saussurea gossypiphora (Asteraceae) and Eriophyton wallichii (Lamiaceae), Cyananthus (Campanulaceae), Polygonum griffithii (Polygonaceae), Saxifraga (Saxifragaceae), Corydalis cashmeriana, the endemic blue poppy Meconopsis violacea and other Meconopsis species (Papaveraceae), Pedicularis species including the endemic Pedicularis nana (Orobanchaceae), Astragalus (Fabaceae), Ranunculus, Caltha paulustris  (Ranunculaceae), Cyprepedium tibeticum (Orchidaceae), Iris 
 
 
(Iridaceae), bulbous species of Fritillaria, Nomocharis souliei, Gagea (Liliaceae) and Allium (Amaryllidaceae), as well as numerous grass (Poaceae) rush (Luzula, Juncaceae) and sedge (Carex, Cyperaceae) species. The shrubs that occur here are dwarf forms including numerous species of Rhododendron, such as R. anthopogon, R. repens, R. campylogynum and the two endemic species R. crebreflorum and R. riparium (Ericaceae). Thin mats of dwarf Rubus and Potentilla fruticosa (Rosaceae), Cassiope and Diplarche (Ericaceae) also occur in the upper ecotone.
Alpine herbfield supports Snow Partridge Lerwa lerwa, Himalayan Monal Lophophorus impejanus, Wood Snipe Gallinago nemoricola (VU), Grandala Grandala coelicolor, Alpine Thrush Zoothera mollissima, Chinese Rubythroat Calliope tschebaiewi and Rufous-breasted Accentor Prunella strophiata. During the summer months Takin Budorcas taxicolor (VU) gather in large groups above treeline and give birth to a single kid along the edge with high mountain scrub. 
Abiotic environment
Low temperatures throughout the year and high rates of precipitation. The duration of snow persistence constrains a very short growing season, and is likely a key environmental determinant of the distribution of this ecosystem, in which there is limited incursion of most plant species that occur at lower elevations.
Key processes and interactions
Temperature limitations (Williams et al., 2015) and variation in the persistence of snow throughout the year are key factors that influence the processes and interactions in this ecosystem. Variation in moisture as a result of variation in snow persistence influences the distribution of plant species, as well as the level of shrub encroachment from adjacent shrubby ecosystem types. Thick snow drifts can also generate a sheer force which may cause local disturbances to this ecosystem, resulting in land slips, loss of vegetation and substantial soil movement (Williams et al., 2015). 
  


Major threats
Alpine herbfields are visited each summer by local people from Myanmar and surrounding countries, and are often used for grazing Yaks. They come to harvest a variety of medicinal plants as well as Cordyceps (shi ba di) for traditional use and sale. Many species are hunted during this time for food while searching for medicine. Alpine ecosystems are thought to be particularly sensitive to climate change, because the fine-scale distribution of plant species is frequently related directly to climate or climate-influenced factors (Pickering et al., 2008), and a warming climate may increase the rates of encroachment by plant species from surrounding ecosystems (Williams et al., 2015). Upward migration has been observed in many Himalayan species (Telwala et al., 2013; Padma, 2014; Dolezal et al., 2016). However, there is high uncertainty about many important factors in the Himalaya that are likely to be influencing this ecosystem, including the distribution of precipitation, and snow and ice melt (Bolch et al., 2012).",41,"T6.4","Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands","Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands occur above the treeline, on temperate and boreal mountains worldwide.

Aerobic karst caves are dark subterranean limestone caves that are air-filled and support simple, low productivity ecosystems (Keith et al., 2019). Owing to light limitation, there is a distinct lack of photosynthentic primary producers and herbivores, and Karst cave biota is therefore typically dominated by detritivores and a few predators. In Myanmar Karst caves are widespread (Waltham and Eavis, 2004). Subterranean streams and pools also occur within Karst voids. These are transitional subterranean-freshwater ecosystems that are distinct from the aerobic ecosystems with which they co-occur, and outside the scope of this assessment. 
High degrees of endemism within, and diversity among isolated karstic hills, caves, and towers result from a multitude of ecological niches afforded by their complex terrain along with their highly fragmented habitat-island nature. The high levels of biodiversity and site-specific endemism in karst habitats rival those of most other habitats throughout the tropics, yet karstic regions are rapidly becoming some of the most imperilled ecosystems on the planet (Clements et al., 2006). Southeast Asia harbors more karst habitat than anywhere else on earth (Day and Ulrich, 2000) but unregulated and unsustainable quarrying practices continue to threaten their integrity and are the primary threat to the survival of karst-associated species. 
Distribution
An estimated 80,000 km2 of Myanmar consists of Karst environments (Day and Urich, 2000). 
  
A recent assessment of bat caves recorded 66 bat caves distributed across Myanmar, which is the best available indicative of the distribution of karst cave ecosystems in Myanmar, but likely underestimates the total number of Karst caves by a substantial margin. The distribution of karst caves follows the distribution of karst, which is primarily located in the Shan plateau, Kayin State, Mon State and Taninthyari Region.
Characteristic native biota
Native biota include invertebrates, fungi, bacteria and some vertebrates, notably bats. One hundred and thirteen species of bat have been recorded in Myanmar, including recently discovered endemics such as the Kachin Woolly Bat (Kerivoula kachinensis; Bates et al, 2004; Darwin Initiative, 2005, Francis, 2019). There is a single near-endemic bird, Greyish Limestone-babbler Turdinus crispifrons restricted to karst in Myanmar and neighboring Thailand. Most biota are well-adapted to light scarcity, including reduced eyes, pigmentation and wings, and specialised non-visual sensory organs (Keith et al., 2019). 
Beyond bats, no publications were found to further identify the characteristic biota of karst caves in Myanmar.
Abiotic environment
Karst caves form in rocky karst environments from the chemical weathering of limestone by surface water or by phreatic sources (Keith et al., 2019). They are characterised by lack of light, except at their openings, and low variability in temperature and humidity.
Key processes and interactions
The availability of light and nutrients is a key ecological driver in cave ecosystems. Energy and nutrients are imported from seepage, tree roots, bats and birds, supporting a biota consisting mainly of detritovores and predators. Karst caves are normally insular in distribution with poor connectivity, and therefore frequently have very high levels of local endemism.
Major threats
Bird nests from karst caves in the Myeik Archipelago are harvested and sold for human consumption (Dreybrodt, 2019). In Thailand and Indonesia, bats are hunted for human consumption, although the extent of this practice in Myanmar is unknown (Clements et al 2006). Cement production is a threat to karst landscapes (Clements et al 2006), and quarrying may threaten caves in nearby areas.",54,"S1.1","Aerobic caves","These air-filled voids beneath the ground are simple low-productivity ecosystems limited by an absence of solar energy, except around their openings to the surface.

Ayeyarwady kanazo swamp forest is an intertidal forest type dominated by the Endangered species Heritiera fomes (‘kanazo’, Stamp, 1925a). It occurs in the upper intertidal zone, normally above true mangroves, where the influence of freshwater is greater and water salinity is much lower than in seawater due to freshwater influx from the floodplain (Kathiresan et al., 2010). The ecosystem is characterised by a tree canopy of up to 25 m, the presence of pneumatophores and occasional flooding by fresh or saltwater (Stamp, 1925a; Davies et al., 2004). Ayeyarwady kanazo swamp forest once occupied very large areas of the Ayeyarwady delta, but its utility for construction, use for fuel wood and close proximity to Yangon, and expansion of rice cropping led to widespread declines of this ecosystem (Stamp, 1924).
Distribution
Suitable habitat and historical records for this ecosystem occurs along the inland edge of the mangrove forest in the Ayeyarwady delta, and fragments may be expected to remain. However, no recent distribution data for this ecosystem exists, although small patches may be confound within mangrove forest maps. Broad species range maps of Heritiera fomes suggest it follows the broad distribution of mangroves in the Ayeyarwady delta and southern Rakhine, possibly also with small occurrences on deltas of the Tanintharyi coast (Kathiresan et al., 2010, Davies et al., 2004). One record of Heritiera fomes is recorded in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), located just north of Yangon.


Characteristic native biota
The characteristic dominant tree species of Ayeyarwady kanazo swamp forest is Heritiera fomes, in association with Aglaia cucullata, Intsia bijuga and Barringtonia acutangula (Davies et al., 2004). These are freshwater mangroves and have morphological and ecophysical traits, such as pneumatophores, to tolerate substrate anoxia. Other woody species include Lagerstroemia speciosa, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and the palm Phoenix paludosa (Davis, 1960). At its lower elevation margins there are likely true mangrove species, including Sonneratia apetala.
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs in the low elevation coastal zone where it typically fringes the upper margins of the intertidal zone where waters may be mildly brackish to fresh (Kress et al., 2003). Continual inundation, particularly in the monsoon season, results in substrate anoxia and peat accumulation. The ecosystem can tolerate low levels of salinity, but generally occurs in the high intertidal zone, above true mangroves, where there is abundant freshwater inflow and groundwater seepage, and saltwater incursion is limited. Ayeyarwady kanazo swamp has very similar dynamics to adjacent Ayeyarwady delta mangrove forest. However, Stamp (1925) notes that kanazo typically requires daily tidal flooding, but must also completely dry for several hours at least twice daily. It does occur in areas that are flooded by freshwater for several months of the year, however, and therefore tends to occur as a fringing forest between mangroves and floodplain ecosystems (Stamp, 1924). 
 
Key processes and interactions
Ayeyarwady kanazo swamp forest has similar processes and interactions as adjacent mangrove forests. It occurs on a marine-freshwater transition, upslope and inland of mangrove, where salinity is low, but varies according to seasonal monsoonal influx of freshwater from the river catchment, and daily tidal influence. Mangroves, particularly Sonneratia apetala occur in the transition zone, but diminish with increasing freshwater influence (Stamp, 1924b). As silt is collected by this vegetation and the sediment elevation increases, Sonneratia apetala is replaced by Kanazo (Heritiera fomes) in the higher elevation intertidal zone (Stamp, 1924). Therefore, continued processes of deposition and a dominance of freshwater inputs over tidal influence are required to sustain this gradient-driven system (Stamp 1924).
Major threats
Due to its occurrence around the upper intertidal zone, remaining Ayeyarwady kanazo swamp forest is highly threatened by coastal development for agriculture and aquaculture (Polidoro et al., 2010). Hertiera fomes is highly valued as timber, for which it is used for house building and boat building. It has also been widely used as fuelwood for more than a century and is considered the most favoured species for charcoal making. One estimate suggests that in 1919-1920, at least 250,000 tons of kanazo was illegally extracted from delta forest reserves (Bryant, 1996). These factors suggest it has probably been more widely deforested than adjacent mangrove forest ecosystems. 
According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Hertiera fomes has quickly disappeared due to coastal development, particularly for aquaculture and rice farming, reductions in water flow regimes, and from timber extraction (Kathiresan et al., 2010).

An evergreen forest consisting of large rainforest trees that fringe the rivers and major streams of Myanmar’s central dry zone. This ecosystem is heavily degraded and only small fragments in various states were found during our field studies. This ecosystem is likely to occur along major streams throughout the Ayeyarwady floodplain in Sagaing, Mandalay and possibly Bago. Buttressed trees are probably present in remnant vegetation (Davis, 1960), although much of these ecosystems are probably replaced now with village forests and plantings. 
Distribution
Central dry evergreen riparian forest has not been mapped. However, it is likely to occur throughout the central dry zone along permanent waterways where remnant vegetation still exists. We estimated the broad extent of this ecosystem by buffering large rivers and streams (200 m) and identifying areas covered in trees. Although there is likely large error to this estimate due to including gardens and planted tree, we expect riparian forest to follow this broad distribution.
Characteristic native biota
This ecosystem occurs above the upper limit of mangrove forests (Stamp 1925). Tree species may include Elaeocarpus hygrophilus (Elaeocarpaceae), Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae), Mangifera caloneura (Anacardiaceae), Calophyllum sp. (Calophyllaceae), Litsea nitida and Aglaia cucullata (Meliaceae). A variety of cane species may also be present (Stamp 1925). No field work was conducted in this ecosystem type, so an extensive inventory of characteristic biota has not been developed.
  
Vines (particularly in family Fabaceae) are common in the understorey and in the tree canopies. The groundlayer includes abundant ferns and forbs.
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs along permanent lowland waterways where there is a reliable year-round water supply. Typically, it occurs on riparian levees, where the forest is seasonally flooded during the monsoon, which occurs between May and October. 
Key processes and interactions
Most species in this ecosystem are adapted to periodic flooding and frequent inundation is a key process that maintains this ecosystem. Floods transport and deposit woody debris and alluvium, promoting habitat diversity for birds and invertebrates, and replenishing soil nutrients. Floods may also create forest gaps enabling tree recruitment. Physical disturbance associated with floods can lead to changes in growth, community composition, light penetration and structure, altering the input of nutrients, organic matter and other detritus. 
Major threats
This ecosystem has been extensively cleared for agriculture, access to waterways and urban development. Likely to have been heavily cut in historical times for timber, which could be used locally or floated downstream. The remaining fragments are very small, continually disturbed by human access and flooding, which promote the invasion of introduced plant species dispersed by floodwaters from disturbed areas upstream. Exotic trees such as Samanea saman (rain tree) are also extensively planted throughout the distribution of this ecosystem type.",70,"TF1.1","Tropical flooded forests and peat forests","These tropical swamps have closed forest canopies and experience high rainfall and consistent temperatures all year.

Mixed delta scrub occurs above the upper limit of Kanazo swamps, on clay soil and where influence of salt water is largely absent. In this area it may be regularly flooded with freshwater. The shrub layer may be cane dominated, which forms very dense thickets, under a canopy of species including Elaeocarpus hygrophils and Lagerstroemia speciosa. Tree cover is relatively low, and thick grassy or cane thickets occur. 
Distribution
Stamp (1925) states that this ecosystem occurs in association with Ayeyarwady Kanazo swamp forest and covers large areas of the Ayeyarwady delta and possibly parts of Tanintharyi. Our remote sensing analysis also suggests a non-mangrove coastal ecosystem with similar spectral properties on a coastal floodplain in northern Rakhine and scattered throughout the lowlands of Tanintharyi.
Characteristic native biota
This ecosystem occurs above the upper limit of mangrove forests (Stamp, 1924b). Tree species may include Elaeocarpus hygrophilus, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Mangifera caloneura, Calphyllum sp., Litsea nitida and Amoora cucullata. A variety of canes may also be present (Stamp, 1924b). No field work was conducted in this ecosystem type, so an extensive inventory of characteristic biota has not been developed.
Abiotic environment
Mixed delta scrub occurs in the low elevation coastal zone, at elevations above mangrove and tropical flooded forests, largely free from saltwater incursion. 
  
It is thought to occur primarily on clay soils (Stamp, 1924b), and may be regularly flooded with freshwater during the monsoon. Mean annual temperature is 26.7° C, with highly seasonal patterns of rainfall averaging to around 3,000 mm per year.

Ayeyarwady floodplain wetlands are shallow, often small, lakes that occur across the Ayeyarwady floodplain. They can be fully vegetated with non-woody vegetation or occur as patches of open water, and undergo regular seasonal drying and filling with monsoonal rain. Generally, they maintain some permanent water in at least part of their distribution throughout the year in most years. 
Distribution
Scattered across the Ayeyarwady floodplain.
Characteristic native biota
Resident aquatic species are adapted to drying and wetting, enabling them to persist through extended dry periods. Grasses dominate including Phragmtes australis, other canegrasses, Leersia and Cynodon dactylon. Aquatic herbs such as Persicaria and Ludwigia are common. Ottelia alismoides is abundant in most permanent and seasonal wetland ecosystems across the Ayeyarwady floodplain (Kress et al., 2003). 
There is a very high abundance and diversity of wetland bird species, including migratory birds, waterbirds and specialist passerines such as Jerdon's Babbler Chrysomma altirostre (VU), Asian Golden Weaver Ploceus hypoxanthus (NT), Streaked Weaver Ploceus manyar, and Yellow-throated Bunting Emberiza elegans (CR). Waterbird species include Lesser Whistling-duck Dendrocygna javanica, Cotton Pygmy-goose Nettapus coromandelianus, Little Grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis, Purple Swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio, Asian Openbill Anastomus oscitans, 
 
 
Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus, Little Cormorant Microcarbo niger, Oriental Darter Anhinga melanogaster (NT), Pheasant-tailed Jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus, Bronze-winged Jacana Metopidius indicus and Black-winged Kite Elanus caeruleus. There is also a very broad range of Herons (Ardeidae), Sandpipers, Snipes and Phalaropes (Scolopacidae). This ecosystem also supports an important population of Fishing Cat Prionailurus viverrinus (VU).
Abiotic environment
This ecosystem occurs as small wetland lakes in shallow depressions and catchments across the flat, sandy Ayeyarwady floodplain. During the monsoon, from May to October, these lakes fill with direct rainfall and from upstream and overbank flows, often increasing the size of open water patches by an order of magnitude. The pronounced dry season, lasting up to 6 months causes significant drying, with deeper wetlands acting as dry season refuge for a wide range of native fauna. 
Key processes and interactions
Filling and drying between wet and dry seasons drive a highly variable ecosystem, with considerable variability in water quality, temperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Depth is shallow (generally <2 m). Some wetlands may retain standing water year-round, within minimal depth in the dry season. They are often isolated for long periods of each year, and may be considerable variability between individual lakes across the distribution of this ecosystem.

Central Ayeyarwady floodplain grasslands have been almost entirely converted to rice paddies. It formerly occurred over vast areas of the flat Ayeyarwady floodplain where it was seasonally inundated with monsoonal rain between about May and October. Now, extensive engineering of levee banks and drainage channels have dramatically altered the majority of this ecosystem type. Floodplain grasslands lack woody vegetation and are completely dominated by grasses that persist through dry periods, although in some areas may remain nearly permanently inundated depending on rainfall patterns. In its natural state, this ecosystem supports a very high abundance of waterbirds, including bitterns, herons, egrets, ibis.
Distribution
Occurs across the majority of the mid- and elevated portions of the Ayeyarwady floodplain. Most have been converted to rice agriculture.
Characteristic native biota
Consists of mostly elephant grass Saccharum arundinaceum, (Kress et al., 2003), but also shorter grasses including Paspalum spp. and Cynodon dactylon (Poaceae). These seasonally wet grasslands support very high abundance and diversity of wetland bird species, including migratory birds, waterbirds and passerines such as Asian Golden Weaver Ploceus hypoxanthus (NT), Streaked Weaver Ploceus manyar and Red Avadavat Amandava amandava.
  
Waterbird species in the wet season include Lesser Whistling Duck Dendrocygna javanica, Asian Openbill Anastomus oscitans, Little Cormorant Microcarbo niger, Yellow Bittern Ixobrychus sinansis, Cinnamon Bittern Ixobrychus cinnamomeus, Intermediate Egret Ardea intermedia, and Little Egret Egretta garzetta.
Abiotic environment
Flat areas of the Ayeyarwady floodplain, slightly more elevated than Ayeyarwady foodplain wetlands and sometimes on slightly sloping surfaces enabling slow drainage. Regular inundation during the monsoonal months of May to October, primarily fed by local rainfall and overbank river flows from upstream, but drying rapidly over the dry season. 
Key processes and interactions
Regular inundation is the primary driver of ecosystem dynamics in this system. A regular influx of water, along with nutrients and aquatic species, supports an assemblage of predator species including migratory waterbirds. During dry periods, mobile fauna migrate to nearby floodplain wetlands that tend to hold water throughout the year.
Major threats
Owing to frequent inundation by freshwater and occurring on flat landforms, the majority of this ecosystem is now converted to rice paddies.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","6","Glacial lakes","Description
Glacial lakes are waterbodies formed by glaciation that are supplied with meltwater from snowpack (Allen et al., 2019). They tend to be located at the terminus, lateral area or beyond the mouth of a glacier (Yao et al., 2018). Two types of glacier lakes occur in Myanmar, those fed directly by glaciers and those that are non-glacier fed; both of these occur in valleys formed by glaciation (Maharjan et al., 2018). The Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) dataset holds 148 glacier records that are within or intersect Myanmar’s border. According to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) reports, there are 267 glacier lakes in Myanmar of which 257 are bedrock-dammed, eight are moraine-dammed and 2 are classified as ‘other’ (Maharjan et al., 2018). In the Himalayas, the size distribution of glacial lakes is typically highly left-skewed as a result of the majority of lakes being smaller than 0.1 km2 (Maharjan et al., 2018, Shukla et al., 2019).
Distribution
Glacial lakes occur in high mountain glacial valleys along the northwest and northeast border in Kachin State. 
Characteristic native biota
Very little is known or published about the characteristic native biota and ecology of Myanmar’s glacial lakes, and no information biota was found during the assessment process.
Abiotic environment
Glacial lakes occur in high mountain regions where low temperature and relatively higher precipitation support the formation of glaciers. In Myanmar, the average altitude of glacial lakes is 4,290 m (Maharjan et al., 2018). Their surface is wholly frozen during winter months and undergo thawing 
  
during the warmer months.
Lakes closer to glaciers are typically fed by glacial meltwater, whereas lakes further down the valley are fed by both glacier meltwater and rainfall, but all occur in steep-sided mountain valleys that have formed as a result of glaciation.
Key processes and interactions
Glacial lakes are fed by glacier meltwater, and are therefore highly sensitive to changes in climate.  The higher confidence of warmer temperature increase and uncertainty of future precipitation patterns as indicated by IPCC (2014) would contribute to the formation of many glaciers in the high mountains of Myanmar. Increases in temperature can lead to increased volume of meltwater while glaciers decline in size, which can lead to an increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) (Khanal et al., 2015).
Major threats
Climate change is the principal threat to glacial lakes. There is some evidence that both the number and size of glacial lakes are increasing in response to climate warming as a result of increased rates of glacial melt (Maharjan et al., 2018). The increasing size of glacial lakes in many areas has led to an increased risk of outburst floods, although the risk of these hazards in Myanmar has not been assessed.",95,"F2.4","Freeze-thaw freshwater lakes","Many plants and animals survive surface freezing of freshwater lakes, in dormant life stages, by reducing activity beneath the ice, or by moving.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","13","Coastal mudflats","Description
Coastal mudflat is the low-sloping, sediment dominated ecosystem that occurs between the high and low spring tides (Dyer, 1998; Healy et al., 2002). In Myanmar, it occurs primarily as extensive unvegetated tidal flats of fine-grained silt and mud that occur in low energy coastal environments (Bird, 2010). Coastal mudflat is an exceptionally dynamic ecosystem, constantly changing in extent through the processes of sediment erosion, deposition and subsidence, compaction that are mostly driven by tidal dynamics and, to a lesser extent, the impacts of the annual monsoon (Murray et al., 2019). 
Distribution
Coastal mudflat occurs along the majority of the Myanmar coastline, particularly in sheltered bays and along low energy, low-sloping regions of the coastline (MacKinnon et al., 2012). The flats are largest where there are large sediment outflows from nearby river systems, large macro-tidal ranges and extensive low-sloping areas of the coastal shelf. A 2016 estimate of the full extent of tidal flats in Myanmar from Landsat data indicated that approximately 3,316 km2 of mudflat occurs along the Myanmar coastline, primarily in the Gulf of Martaban, Tanintharyi coastline and in the sheltered bays and inlets of the Rakhine coast (Murray et al., 2019). 
An analysis of habitat for migratory shorebirds suggested that there are nine major coastal mudflat complexes that occur in all coastal provinces, including (from north to south), Nan Thar Island, Hunters Bay, Natkan, the Ayeyarwady Delta (east and west), the area around the outer islands, the Gulf of Mottama, Ahlat and the mudflats around Bilugyun Island 
  
and, in the south, the Dawei River mouth and mudflats south of Myeik in Tanintharyi (Zöckler et al., 2014). Furthermore, the Myanmar directory of important wetlands indicates that most of the 19 coastal sites identified as being national and regionally important contain large areas of coastal mudflat (Zöckler et al., 2018). 
Characteristic native biota
Coastal mudflat is typically non-vegetated, but the sediments contain microalgae and benthic diatoms, and potentially some seagrass in low abundance. They support numerous burrowing invertebrates, including clams, worms, shrimp, crabs and amphipods (Healy et al., 2002). Despite extensive literature searches, detailed information on diversity, relative abundance and community composition of the benthos in Myanmar was not found.
A wide variety of predatory vertebrates are dependent on this benthic biota, including birds, fish, aquatic and terrestrial mammals and reptiles. It supports a variety of resident, local migratory and long-distance waterbird species, including herons, egrets, storks, gulls and terns. Several of these are IUCN listed globally threatened species, including Spoon-billed Sandpiper Calidris pygmea (CR), Spotted Greenshank Tringa guttifer (EN) and Lesser Adjutant Leptoptilos javanicus (VU) (Naing 2006). The most visible and perhaps most studied biota in coastal mudflat is the seasonal influx of migratory shorebirds including Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus, Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata (NT), and Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea (NT), that often occur in huge flocks of up to 40,000 individuals (Zockler et al., 2010; Zöckler et al., 2014). Migratory shorebirds are being monitored annually through the Asian Waterbird Census (Mundkur et al., 2017), surveys of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force and others.
Various species of marine mammals including dolphin feed in the coastal waters over the mudflats at high tide, especially, the Irrawaddy Dolphin Orcaella brevirostris (EN). Mammals like Crab-eating Macaque Macaca fascicularis, and Smooth Otter Lutra perspicillata (VU) and reptiles like Estuarine Crocodile (LC) are recorded in Meinmahlakyun Wildlife Sanctuary (also Ramsar Site and East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership Network Site) in the mouth of the Ayeyarwady Delta. 
Abiotic environment
Coastal mudflats undergo regular tidal inundation, and therefore typically occur a few metres above and below mean sea-level, typically in low-sloping, low-energy coastal environments with relatively large tidal ranges (Murray et al., 2014). The sediments are continually waterlogged and maintain salinity levels approximately the same as seawater, increasing as waters evaporate at low tide. The low-energy abiotic environment is necessary to maintain their fine sediment substrate (Fan, 2012; Murray et al., 2015).
Key processes and interactions
Coastal mudflats maintain a fine balance of sediment erosion and deposition, whereby tidal currents and waves both deposit and erode fine-scale sediments (Fan, 2012). This process is generally governed by wave dynamics, the benthic community, sediment texture, sediment size, occurrence of vegetation (Healy et al., 2002; Adam, 2009). Regular tidal inundation regulates salinity levels within the sediment. Benthic biota support local bioturbation, biodeposition and biotransportation (Kuwae et al., 2012; Murray et al., 2015). Tidal ranges across Myanmar are typically about 2 m but increase to over 6 m in areas where there are major complexes of tidal flat, such as the Gulf of Martaban (Bird, 2010).
Major threats
Coastal mudflat in Myanmar is threatened by coastal development, harvesting, hunting and bycatch of native biota, sea-level rise, particularly where they are adjacent to coastal developments (MacKinnon et al., 2012; Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Murray et al., 2019). In many regions, housing is built directly on mudflat (Satake et al., 2006). Coastal vegetation loss has also been shown to threaten coastal mudflat ecosystems elsewhere in the world, with mechanistic models suggesting that it drives increased erosion and is therefore a plausible pathway to loss of area and ecosystem collapse (Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013; Weston, 2014). Although losses of tidal flats to reclamation and coastal development in Myanmar is estimated at <5% of their total extent since 1970, there is growing concern about the impact of proposed coastal developments, including port developments, infrastructure associated with oil and gas extraction, aquaculture and hydropower plants (MacKinnon et al., 2012; Zöckler et al., 2013; Mentaschi et al., 2018).",158,"MT1.2","Muddy shorelines","Mudflats occur on low-energy coastlines.

Sandy shoreline is an exposed, physically dynamic ecosystem consisting of a surf zone, sandy beach and sand dune systems (Brown and McLachlan, 2002). Owing to its unstable substrate, sandy shoreline is a dynamic ecosystem that is typically hostile to biota. Biotic assemblages are primarily structured by physical forces, which include erosion, deposition of sediment throughout the adjacent surf, beach and dune zones (Defeo et al., 2009; Luijendijk et al., 2018). 
Distribution
In Myanmar, sandy shorelines are scattered along the coastlines of Rakhine State, Ayeyarwady Region, Mon State and Tanintharyi Region (Bird, 2010). Along the west-facing Rakhine and Ayeyrawady coasts, sandy beaches most commonly occur in large sandy bays, before changing to long sandy beaches of the south-facing Ayeyrawady coastline, and may be particularly extensive at low tide due to large tidal range (Bird, 2010). Sandy shorelines also occur over much of the open coast of Mon and Tanintharyi, where they are interspersed with coastal mudflat and tropical mangrove ecosystems (Zöckler et al., 2013). A recent analysis suggested less than 5% of the Myanmar coastline is sandy (Luijendijk et al., 2018).
Characteristic native biota

Sandy beaches in Myanmar harbour epifauna such as crabs, molluscs, isopods and amphipods, as well as infauna such as bivalves and polychaetes (Whitten and Damanik, 2012). These avoid desiccation and predation by burrowing. Most are detritivores or filter feeders. Diperterans and other insects 
  
live off wrack of seagrass and kelp deposited at the high water mark. Sandy beach ecosystems also support a wide variety resident and migratory birds, including migratory shorebirds, waterbirds, gulls and terns. There are five species of sea turtle that regularly breed on Myanmar’s beaches, Olive Ridley Lepoideochely olivacea (VU), Loggerhead Caretta caretta (NT), Green Chelonia mydas (EN), Hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricate (CR) and Leatherback Dermochelys coriacea (CR) (Zöckler et al., 2013).
Abiotic environment
A dynamic environment with unstable coarse-grained substrates, sandy shoreline consists of accumulations of wave deposited particles that are sourced from inland erosion and sub-aqueous sedimentary environments. It may also include marine biogenic sources, such as coral skeletons, shells and sponges. They are found on higher-energy coastlines than mudflats. Sandy shorelines do not typically depend on any particular temperature or precipitation regime, although they tend to have a greater extent outside of tropical regions where low-energy coastlines frequently support extensive mangrove ecosystems (Luijendijk et al., 2018). 
Key processes and interactions
The primary processes and interactions in sandy shoreline ecosystems relate to waves, tidal regimes and sediment availability (Whitten et al., 2000). Tidal regimes create strong desiccation gradients, which are tolerated through a range of behavioural and physiological traits in the fauna. Water movement and its influence on sediment deposition is a key factor that determines the physical states of sandy shorelines, which in turn governs the dynamics of the ecological community. Periodic storms cause major mobilisation of sand, which may take months or years for replacement.
Major threats
Sandy shoreline ecosystems in Myanmar may be threatened by coastal development, particularly for tourism resorts, quarrying sand for roads and construction, and beach erosion (Schlacher et al., 2007; Zöckler et al., 2013; Luijendijk et al., 2018). Vehicle use may be an increasing threat.

Tanintharyi coastal dune forest occurs as a thin band of vegetation along the Tanintharyi coastline. The coastal dune forest primarily occurs in sheltered hind-dune locations where it tolerates salt spray, exposed conditions, and nutrient deficient soil (Stamp, 1924b). However, despite tolerating salt spray, it is beyond the influence of tidal inundation and cannot occur in areas regularly inundated by high tides. 
Distribution
In Tanintharyi, coastal dune forest occurs as a thin strip behind sandy beaches on the summit of foredunes and sandbars, scattered along the entire Tanintharyi coastline (Stamp, 1924b; Kress et al., 2003). Its distribution typically follows the distribution of sandy beaches. No map data is available for this ecosystem.
Characteristic native biota
Stamp (1924b) reports that Taninthyari coastal dune forest is dominated by Casuarina equisetifolia, which is more abundant than any other tree species. The groundlayer includes the creeping Ipomea pes-caprae and salt-tolerant coastal grasses (Stamp, 1924b; Kress et al., 2003). Casuarina is generally more abundant than Coconut Palm Cocos nucifera in this ecosystem.
Abiotic environment
Coastal dune forest occurs in sandy soils directly adjacent to sandy shorelines, saltmarsh and coastal mudflat. This pioneering zone is exposed to coastal winds, sand deposition and salt spray. It occurs above the highest spring tide line due to an intolerance of saltwater inundation (Stamp, 1924b).


Key processes and interactions
Rapidly draining sandy soils, which may be unstable and easily mobilised, contribute to the 
dry, harsh environment that this ecosystem occupies. Few grazing animals are likely present, with most dispersal being driven by coastal winds and marine currents. Periodic storms disturb vegetation cover and mobilise sands, fueling continual dynamics and turnover in the ecosystem.

They therefore occur beyond the influence of tides primarily on sandy soils.

Rakhine coastal dune forest occurs adjacent to sandy beaches along much of the Rakhine and Ayeyarwardy coastline that fringes the Bay of Bengal (Stamp, 1924b). The distribution of this ecosystem type therefore closely follows the distribution of sandy shorelines and coastal mudflats, mainly along the western coast of Ayeyarwady province. No map data is available for this ecosystem.
Characteristic native biota
Characteristic species include coconut palm Cocos nucifera, Terminalia sp, Fabaceae spp., and scattered Casuarina equisetifolia (rarely dominant as in Tanintharyi, Kress et al., 2003). Introduced tree species are common, including Tamarindus indica and Samanea saman (raintree). The shrub layer includes Gardenia spp. and Fabaeae spp. a ground layer of creeping species including Ipomea pes-caprae and Fabaceae spp. and herbs of the Asteraceae and Solanaceae.
Abiotic environment
Coastal dune forest occurs in sandy soils and dunes directly adjacent to sandy shoreline ecosystems and coastal mudflats (Whitten and Damanik, 2012). This pioneering zone is highly exposed to coastal winds, sand deposition and salt 
spray. They occur above the highest spring tide line. Moving away from the coast, the coastal dune forest would typically transition into savanna and semi-evergreen forest ecosystems further inland or wetlands in adjacent depressions. However, owing to extensive deforestation, the remaining coastal dune forests occurring in Rakhine are typically bounded by cropland (particularly rice and coconut) that has been developed along the flat coastal plain. 
Key processes and interactions
This ecosystem occurs in harsh, salty coastal environments behind dynamic sandy beaches. It occurs in areas of fast-draining and highly mobile sandy substrates, where an ability to tolerate hot and dry conditions enables this ecosystem to persist. Periodic storms cause physical disturbance to vegetation and occasionally result in storm surge, inundating the soils with salt water, which may kill some of the standing vegetation.
Major threats
Threats to Rakhine coastal dune forest are mostly related to the expansion of agriculture and coastal development, including residential and tourist infrastructure across Rakhine’s coastal zone. The incursion of rice farming and other agricultural activities may lead to deforestation of this ecosystem type. Physical disturbance promotes invasion of introduced plant species. Similarly, coastal development for roads, resorts and urban expansion also threaten this ecosystem type. Sea level rise could threaten this ecosystem, but its potential impacts are considered highly uncertain due to a lack of information on the distribution and dynamics of this ecosystem.",163,"MT2.1","Coastal shrublands and grasslands","A low diversity of specialised plants and animals live in grasslands, shrublands, and low forests on coastlines above the high tide mark where they are exposed to harsh conditions of salt influx, desiccating winds and sunshine, and disturbances associated with storms or unstable substrates (e.g. cliffs and dunes).

Myanmar tropical mangrove forests have a closed canopy that are predominantly evergreen. Tanintharyi mangrove forests occur from 9°N up to approximately latitude 16°N. They typically occur along open-coast and sheltered areas of soft-sediment (Bird, 2010). In Tanintharyi, mangroves are estimated to occupy approximately 2,500 km2 (Gaw et al., 2018).
Distribution
This ecosystem occurs along the west facing coastline of Tanintharyi, and are delimited in this assessment by the Salween (Thanlwin) River to the north in southern Mon State. 
Characteristic native biota
These are the most botanically diverse mangrove forests in Myanmar. WWF ecoregion description lists Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophera apiculata, Sonneratia caseolaris, Ceriops tegal, Xyloxarpus granatum, Avicennia officinalis, and Bruguiera spp. as key species in this ecosystem type. The diversity of tree species makes the canopy structurally complex. Stilt roots create additional structural complexity beneath the canopy. There is a small group of mangrove specialized breeding birds including Brown-winged Kingfisher Pelargopsis amauroptera (NT), Ruddy Kingfisher Halcyon coromanda, Mangrove Pitta Pitta megarhyncha (NT), Golden-bellied Gerygone Gerygone sulphurea, and Mangrove Whistler Pachycephala cinereal (Rasmussen and Anderton, 2012). Migratory shorebirds may also be present in this ecosystem, utilising vegetation for roosting habitat and foraging among the aerial roots and pneumatophores at low tide (Hogarth, 2015). 
 
 
Abiotic environment
Tanintharyi mangrove forests occur in low energy coastal areas where soft sediments are regularly inundated throughout the tidal cycle. Regular tidal inundation leads to a highly saline environment.
Key processes and interactions
Tidal inundation is the most important process occurring in tropical mangrove ecosystems. The regular influx of saline water serves to mobilise detritus (leaf litter etc.), which is broken down by macro- and micro-organisms (Whitten and Damanik, 2012). 
These macro and microorganisms form an important food source for crustaceans and fish, which in turn are important food sources for larger predators. 
The mangroves also play a significant role in ecosystem functioning, serving as nursery habitat for fish, influencing sediment dynamics and producing organic matter (Figure 1).

Major threats
Palm oil is emerging as a key threat to tropical mangrove forest in Myanmar, where suitable soil and climatic conditions exist for the industry to expand (Gaw et al., 2018). Indeed, a recent remote sensing analysis showed that 432 km2 of mangroves in Tanintharyi were transformed into oil palm plantation between 1995 and 2015 (De Alban et al., 2018). Myanmar has set an ambitious target to become self-sufficient in palm oil production, and Tanintharyi is the only region suitable for palm oil production (Friess et al., 2019). Other threats include overharvesting for charcoal and firewood and deforestation for rice production, aquaculture and infrastructure. Recent reports suggest that sand mining is rapidly increasing in the region, which may cause the erosion of estuarine mangroves.",169,"MFT1.2","Intertidal forests and shrublands","Mangroves create structurally complex and productive ecosystems in the intertidal zone of depositional coasts, around tropical and warm temperate regions.

Ayeyarwady delta mangrove forest is dominated by trees tolerant of salinity, tidal inundation and substrate anoxia. Salt tolerance is conferred by osmotic regulation and salt excretion. Specialised structure such as aerial stilt roots, lenticels and aerenchymatous tissues transport oxygen to roots. High primary productivity and litter fall sustains a web of detritivores and their predators. At high tide, mangroves are important nursery grounds for juvenile fish (Spalding, 2001). 
Distribution
Ayeyarwady delta mangrove forest occurs in the intertidal zone across the Ayeyarwady Delta, which is defined by Cape Negrais in the west and the Thanlwin (Salween) River in the east. This ecosystem was originally the largest tract of mangroves in Myanmar (Webb et al., 2014). The earliest reliable area estimate (1978) for the total mangrove distribution in the Ayeyarwady Delta was 2,623 km2 (Webb et al., 2014), though other accounts suggest that mangroves may have covered 2,345 km2 in 1954 (Oo, 2002).
Characteristic native biota
Complex forest composed of trees from multiple taxa including Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia officinalis, Bruguiera sexangular, Excoecaria agallocha and Sonneratia caseolaris. Up to 33 mangrove species have been recorded in this system (U Win Maung, pers. comm.) out of a total of 34 recorded nationally (Aye et al., 2019). Nypa fruticans may occur in the upper intertidal zone where there is more freshwater influence, although its presence may have increased in response to human disturbance. The area provides habitat for several threatened vertebrates, 
  
including Irrawaddy dolphin Orcaella brevirostris (EN), Estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus and Mangrove Terrapin Batagur baska (CR). There is a small group of mangrove specialized breeding birds including Brown-winged Kingfisher Pelargopsis amauroptera (NT), Ruddy Kingfisher Halcyon coromanda, Mangrove Pitta Pitta megarhyncha (NT), and Mangrove Whistler Pachycephala cinereal (Rasmussen and Anderton, 2012). Migratory shorebirds may also be present in this ecosystem, utilising vegetation for roosting habitat and foraging among the aerial roots and pneumatophores at low tide (Hogarth, 2015). There are relatively few mammals in the area but Smooth Otter Lutrogale perspicillata (VU) and Fishing Cat Prionailurus viverrinus (VU) have both been recorded (Francis, 2019).
Abiotic environment
Mangroves occur in coastal areas where they are inundated by seawater during the diurnal tidal cycle. This high salinity environment generally occurs along the coastal fringe, and is important for reducing incursion of other non-halophytic vascular plants (Marshall et al., 2018). Being well adapted to highly saline environments, mangroves also tend to occur in anaerobic and waterlogged soil, although not exclusively (Hogarth, 2015). 
Key processes and interactions
The mangrove trees drive most of the processes and functions in this ecosystem, providing nursery habitat for fish and shrimp, controlling and responding to sedimentation processes and generating organic matter that contribute to carbon and nutrient cycles (Marshall et al., 2018). In general, mangrove distribution is constrained by cool temperatures (Figure 1), but these are not limiting in Myanmar. They are also regulated by wave action, tides and sea level (Figure 1).
Major threats
The Ayeyarwady Delta has undergone extensive deforestation as a result of high human population (around 8 million people) and widespread agricultural development (Oo, 2002; Webb et al., 2014). The delta region hosts around 14% of Myanmar's population and is responsible for around 35% of the country's rice production (Webb et al., 2014). Rice is thus a well-documented threat to mangroves in the region, primarily driving widespread deforestation and modification of hydrology (Webb et al., 2014; Richards and Freiss, 2016). Mangrove deforestation as a result of aquaculture, salt farming and fuelwood extraction have also been documented throughout the Ayeyarwady delta region (Webb et al., 2014; De Alban et al., 2020).",169,"MFT1.2","Intertidal forests and shrublands","Mangroves create structurally complex and productive ecosystems in the intertidal zone of depositional coasts, around tropical and warm temperate regions.

Sparsely vegetated coastal ecosystem, characterised by dwarf Avicennia shrubs growing on intertidal shingle and rocky tidal flats. This environment tends to occur in areas exposed to low-moderate wave action that have not accumulated deep sediments characteristic of other mangrove ecosystems.
Distribution
No maps of dwarf mangrove shrubland on shingle exist, but this ecosystem may occur in very small patches along the Myanmar coastline where large rock platforms and suitable environmental conditions allow. Only two confirmed patches are currently known, one in Rakhine State and one in Tanintharyi state (Zaw Myo Hein, pers. comm).
Characteristic native biota
Primarily composed of Avicennia officinalis (Acanthaceae) shrubs growing to <1.5 m in height. Intertidal fauna includes migratory shorebirds and other waterbirds, such as Striated Heron Butorides striata, Little Egret Egretta garzetta and Pacific Reef-egret Egretta sacra.
Abiotic environment
Dwarf mangrove on shingle occurs on rock platforms where it undergoes regular tidal inundation. Individual trees typically grow in depressions on the tidal platform above the surf zone. Dwarfism in mangroves is most likely linked with hydroedaphic conditions, where very low soil moisture at low tide leads to severe water stress (Naidoo, 2006). High soil salinity and nutrient limitation are also likely, resulting from the location of this ecosystem in the rocky intertidal zone (Naidoo, 2006). 
 
 
Key processes and interactions
Dwarfism in mangroves is a widespread phenomenon that is commonly attributed to high salinity, poor aeration, waterlogging, compaction, and nutrient limitation (Naidoo, 2006). However, in rocky areas it is also likely related to shallow sediment and associated desiccation, preventing establishment of individuals of normal height. Avicennia is a halophytic species, and therefore requires ongoing tidal inundation by saltwater.
Major threats
Dwarf mangrove ecosystems in Myanmar are subject to a relatively low number of anthropogenic threats, owing to occurring in rocky intertidal zones that are generally not converted to other land uses. Sea-level rise and severe tropical cyclones are likely to influence the ability of this ecosystem to persist into the future (Alongi, 2002; Thompson et al., 2002; Cazenave and Le Cozannet, 2013) (Figure 1). A single occurrence of a severe tropical storm could results in total loss of a patch of this ecosystem, and therefore this ecosystem may be restricted to as few as two threat-defined locations.",169,"MFT1.2","Intertidal forests and shrublands","Mangroves create structurally complex and productive ecosystems in the intertidal zone of depositional coasts, around tropical and warm temperate regions.

Rakhine mangrove forest on mud occupies the intertidal zone of the Rakhine coastline. In this region, mangroves occur on soft, muddy, waterlogged sediments, primarily within sheltered bays and inlets. They are exposed to very high water salinity as a result of regular tidal incursion (Spalding, 2001) and are often fringed by groves of Nipa palms, which mark the transition to other ecosystems.
Distribution
Occurs along the Bay of Bengal coastline of Myanmar, encompassing the entire Rakhine coastline and into far west Ayeyarwady state. The southern distributional limit is Cape Negrais.
Characteristic native biota
Based on the Wunbaik mangrove forest reserve, a region with the most preserved mangrove forests within Rakhine, there are 28 observed mangrove species, including the critically endangered Bruguiera hainseii (Myint and Stanley, 2011). Species include Aegialitis rotundifolia, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia alba, Avicennia marina, Avicennia officinalis, Bruguiera cylindrical, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Bruguiera hainesii, Bruguiera parviflora, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops decandra, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Heritiera fomes, Heritiera littoralis, Kandelia candel, Lumnitzera littorea, Lumnitzera racemose, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculate, Rhizophora mucronata, Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea, Sonneratia alba, Sonneratia apetala, Sonneratia caseolaris, Sonneratia griffithii, Xylocarpus granatum, Xylocarpus moluccensis (Myint and Stanley, 2011).
 
There is a small group of mangrove specialized breeding birds including Brown-winged Kingfisher Pelargopsis amauroptera (NT), Ruddy Kingfisher Halcyon coromanda, Mangrove Pitta Pitta megarhyncha (NT), and Mangrove Whistler Pachycephala cinereal (Rasmussen and Anderton, 2012). This is supplemented with migratory shorebirds roosting in the mangroves during high tides between October and April. Migratory shorebirds may also be present in this ecosystem, utilising vegetation for roosting habitat and foraging among the aerial roots and pneumatophores at low tide (Hogarth, 2015).
Abiotic environment
In Rakhine, mangrove forest on mud occurs in areas where soft sediments are regularly inundated throughout the tidal cycle. They occur primarily in sheltered saline waters of embayments and estuaries with low wave energy, where recruitment of mangroves can naturally occur (Hogarth 2015). 
Key processes and interactions
As with all mangrove ecosystems, the mangrove species themselves drive the majority of ecosystem processes, including providing nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans, controlling sedimentation processes that enables them to maintain their elevation and generating organic matter that contribute to carbon and nutrient cycles. In general mangrove distributions are limited by cool temperatures (Figure 1), but these are not limiting in Myanmar. They are also regulated by wave action, tides and sea level (Figure 1).

Major threats
Deforestation is the primary threat to mangroves along the Rakhine Coast, with this being considered a hotspot for mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia after losing >10% of mangrove forest per 1 degree grid cell in many parts of the state between 2000-2012 (Richards and Friess, 2016). Drivers of deforestation include conversion into settlements, shrimp farms and rice paddies, with degradation attributed to wood cutting, brick-baking and bark peeling in some areas (Saw and Kanzaki, 2015; ; De Alban et al., 2020). The region is also periodically exposed to cyclones (Storey, 2015), causing physical damage and altering sedimentation supply (Ward et al., 2016)",169,"MFT1.2","Intertidal forests and shrublands","Mangroves create structurally complex and productive ecosystems in the intertidal zone of depositional coasts, around tropical and warm temperate regions.

"2024/06/17 00:00:00",5,"unsw_myan_eco_2020","raster","mm_ecosys_v7b","Raster code","12","Grassy saltmarsh","Description
Saltmarshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that undergo periodic flooding by saline water (Adam, 1993). They typically border saline water bodies, where water fluctuations (either tidal or non-tidal) flood the vegetation, which is dominated by grasses, sedges or herbs, but trees are absent or very sparse. In coastal environments, coastal saltmarshes are highly dynamic and typically fringe low energy coastlines, often occurring above areas of coastal mudflat, seagrass or mangroves.
Distribution
Saltmarshes are very poorly known in Myanmar and, to our knowledge, no confirmed occurrences of saltmarsh ecosystems have been recorded. However, given that they occur along the nearby coasts and rivers of Bangladesh (Siddique et al., 2012), as well as other tropical regions, they are likely to occur in coastal areas not dominated by mangroves or dynamic sediment-dominated systems such as sandy shorelines and coastal mudflats. In this environment they would probably consist of grasses and herbs in flat areas adjacent to saline waterbodies (P. Adam, pers. comm.). It is possible that saltmarshes in Myanmar have been wholly converted to agricultural land for aquaculture and rice farming.
Characteristic native biota
Saltmarshes typically have low plant diversity and are dominated by a few species, tending to increase in diversity further away from the seaward margin. Invertebrate and microbial species richness can be very high. Saltmarshes are poorly known in Myanmar, and no information is available on their characteristic biota.
Abiotic environment
Although they are exposed to air for the majority of the time, saltmarshes undergo periodic flooding from saline water sources, mostly as a result of tidal fluctuations in coastal environments. They therefore occur up to about the highest astronomical tide, and rarely below mean high water neap tide (Adam 1993).  Saltmarsh soils are frequently waterlogged and anaerobic, primarily owing to slow drainage after inundation as a result of low-sloping topography. The soils may accumulate very high concentrations of salt during dry phases, until flushed by tides or overland flow after rains. Saltmarshes may also occur where there is significant influence of salt spray or increased salinity due to evapotranspiration, but are not tidally inundated (P. Adam, pers. comm.). Intertidal saltmarsh fauna is typically absent in these non-tidal saltmarshes.
Key processes and interactions
The interaction between biota and physical processes is a key feature of saltmarsh ecosystems. Salt tolerant vegetation plays an essential role in trapping sediment, which maintains their elevation and extent, and balances the physical process of erosion. Ongoing sediment supply offsets erosion and contributes to their ability to maintain extent with sea level rise. Salinity levels may fluctuate widely in response to the timing of tidal submergence, freshwater influx and drying.
Major threats
With little known about grassy saltmarsh ecosystems in Myanmar, it is difficult to assess major threats to this ecosystem. However, its habitat along rivers, around estuaries and in flat coastal areas is particularly threatened by conversion to agriculture, changing flood and sedimentation regimes of rivers and sea level rise (Adam, 2002).",170,"MFT1.3","Coastal saltmarshes and reedbeds","Coastal salt marshes and reedbeds are mosaics of salt-tolerant grasses and low, typically succulent shrubs. structured by strong gradients of salinity and tidal influence. Salts may approach hypersaline levels near the limit of high spring tides, especially in the tropics. As well as larger plants, algal mats and phytoplankton contribute to productivity, while freshwater run-off and tides bring organic material and nutrients. Bacteria and fungi decompose biomass in oxygen-poor subsoils, and support a range of crustaceans, worms, snails and small fish. Shorebirds breed and forage in saltmarshes, with migratory species dispersing plants and animals.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.3","ValueToValue",,"Nick_Murray","final",,TRUE,"David_Keith",2.1,NA,NA,"001","0005001"
