Filter feeders are most common in higher energy areas of currents and wave action. Primary producers are limited by substrate instability or light, with seagrass ecosystems (M1.1) occurring where these factors are not limiting to plant establishment and persistence. Low structural habitat complexity means a lack of shelter, and many organisms display predator avoidance traits like burrowing, shells or camouflage (e.g. sole).","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.7","ValueToValue",,"Ben_Cresswell","final",,NA,NA,NA,"Think we need to revisit how we deal with sand in these CR datasets",NA
