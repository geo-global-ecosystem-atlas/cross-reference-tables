They have very low productivity and diversity in extreme cold conditions. Nutrients are in short supply, and generally come from glacial debris, seawater or guano. At the base of simple foodwebs, micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and algae are the dominant life forms, although itinerant vertebrates make important contributions to nutrient and carbon subsidies. Micro-organisms are often dispersed by wind, and accumulate organic matter at the surface, fuelling microbial activity both at the surface, and below the ice. Productivity is restricted to summer months, when migratory birds and mammals visit.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T6.1","ValueToValue",,"Naema_GrosDubois","final",,TRUE,"Jose_Ferrer_Paris",2.1,NA,NA

Productivity and biomass are limited by extreme cold, rocky substrate and strong winds. Algae, lichens, mosses and bacteria support a short and simple foodweb in the summer months, with cold-tolerant invertebrates such as tardigrades. Some rocky sites provide nesting sites for birds in summer. Substrate weathering and guano are major nutrient inputs. These systems are periodically disturbed as accumulated snow and ice collapses down steep slopes.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T6.2","ValueToValue",,"Naema_GrosDubois","final",,TRUE,"Jose_Ferrer_Paris",2.1,NA,NA
