Sunlight is too dim for photosynthesis, but in the upper mesopelagic zone there is enough to enable some visual predators to exploit their prey. Often used as a refuge by species that migrate upward at night to feed in more productive epipelagic waters when predation risk is lower, it supports a high but unknown biomass of fish and planktonic detritivores, relying on flux of nutrients from upper oceanic layers.
