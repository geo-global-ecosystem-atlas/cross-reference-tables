They currently cover 11% of the world’s land surface. Some systems of management include domestic herbivores introduced on harvested stubble or in ‘fallow’ years. These are structurally simple, very low-diversity, high-productivity systems, dominated by one or few non-woody, shallow-rooted annual plant species such as grains (mostly C3 grasses), vegetables, ‘cut flowers’, legumes, or fibre plants harvested annually by humans for commercial or subsistence production of food, materials, or ornamental displays.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/T7.1","ValueToValue",,"Simi_Komenda","final",,TRUE,"Naema_GrosDubois",2.1,NA,NA,"001","0172001"
