Offshore, the algal vegetation is dense. Brown algae grow to many metres in length. Southern kelps, particularly the bull kelp, Durvillaea antarctica, from the high tide limit to more than 15m depth, and Macrocystis pyrifera, form impressive masses of floating fronds, particularly prominent along the sheltered eastern coast. The great size of individual marine algal plants contrasts with the short stature of the terrestrial vegetation.",121,"M1.2","Kelp forests","Kelps (large, brown macroalgae up to 30m in length) form the basis of these highly productive systems found on shallow, subtidal rocky reefs around cold temperate and polar coastlines. Their forest-like structure and vertical habitat supports diverse epiflora and –fauna living on the kelp itself, as well as rich communities of invertebrates, fish and marine birds and mammals living and foraging in and around these ecosystems. High nutrient requirements mean these ecosystems are often associated with upwelling water, while wave action and currents are important for replenishing oxygen.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/M1.2","ValueToValue",,"David_Keith","final",,TRUE,"David_Keith",2.1,NA,NA,"001","0002001"

They are landscape sponges, with highly specialised plant life including shrubs, sedges and mosses equipped to grow in acidic, nutrient-poor, low-oxygen, waterlogged soils.

These animals consume large amounts of marine resources but spend many weeks and months on land, accumulating high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients. The abundance and relatively large body size of individuals disrupt the growth of vegetation. The combination of these factors means that microbial activity is high and soil invertebrates are abundant, but plant diversity is usually low, and land based grazers and predators are usually absent.","https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MT2.2","ValueToValue",,"David_Keith","final",,TRUE,"David_Keith",2.1,NA,NA,"001","0002001"

Poa foliosa and S. polaris may occur in almost monospecific stands, but they commonly occur together. The tall vegetation is absent on gentler slopes near the coast where drainage is poor, and on unstable surfaces such as active scree, outwash fans, and crumbling rocky outcrops.

There is commonly a mosaic of polygonal patches in which both the bare ground and the edges of the vegetated areas are subject to erosion. Also common are alternating stripes of vegetation and bare ground, often in the form of stepped benches or terraces. Bryophytes become dominant or codominant with angiosperms such as Azorella macquariensis in the most exposed places.

It ranges from extensive stands of Acaena spp. that are almost monospecific to communities made up of most of the vascular species of the island.
